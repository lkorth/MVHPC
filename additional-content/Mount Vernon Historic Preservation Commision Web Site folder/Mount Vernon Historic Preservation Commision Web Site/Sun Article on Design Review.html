		<p>          The booklet, which delineates the architectural design guidelines for the city, provides simple suggestions and illustrations for maintaining the historic character and integrity of Mount Vernon's architectural heritage. Depending on where you live in the city, the booklet may serve as only a guide, leaving you free to follow or ignore the suggestions, or it may have the force of law. You are encouraged to ask the committee for comments and ideas about your plans even if you do not live within a historic district.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>          The City of Mount Vernon passed an ordinance in March of 2000 providing for the review of proposed improvements and modifications to structures in the City's historic districts by a design review committee (a subset of the Historic Preservation Commission). The committee includes a wide variety of architectural and historical expertise. The review will include an evaluation of plans for compliance with the guidelines. The review committee will offer ideas, suggestions, and alternatives where appropriate. Commission chairman Sauter indicated that the review is a complementary professional review service for property owners.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>          If you propose work on a structure in one of Mount Vernon's three historic districts you must submit your proposed work for review before you proceed. A map of the districts can be found in the design guidelines booklet. If the work requires a building permit (additions, new construction, signs, porches, etc.) a review and compliance with the guidelines is mandatory. If the work does not require a permit (new or modified windows, doors, roof changes, and similar items) a review by the committee is mandatory but compliance is voluntary. The submittal and review should be done prior to ordering any materials or doing any work on the project.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>          This ordinance is designed to protect our architectural heritage, improve property values, and preserve the feel of Mount Vernon. The process will be monitored for the next year by the Council and Commission for compliance, fairness, and effectiveness. Your input is welcome.<br>
