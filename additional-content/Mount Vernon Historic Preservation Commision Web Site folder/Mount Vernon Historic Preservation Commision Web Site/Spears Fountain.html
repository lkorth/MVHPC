			<p>&quot;On a circular stone plinth rising some 8 inches above the great circle of cement pavement stands a hexagonal block of solid granite which serves as a base for a bronze fountain piece designed with 3 dolphins. The sides of the granite block are ornamented in strong relief with six chubby infants in happy dance bearing up a fruit garland that passes in festoons around the block.&quot; C.C. Bulletin November 1, 1906<br>

			<p>There is now a bronze fountainhead missing. There is also a crack running from the top to the bottom on the northeast side. It was dedicated to Annie F. Spear-erected by the class of 1881. <br>
