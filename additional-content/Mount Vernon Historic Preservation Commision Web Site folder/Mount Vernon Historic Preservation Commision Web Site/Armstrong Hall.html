			<p>History/Comments:<br>
			</p>
			<p>Armstrong Hall is one of three major buildings constructed during the Depression. It is illustrative of the growth of Midwest liberal arts colleges. Frank H. Armstrong, who spent his early years in Mount Vernon, became a Chicago businessman. He was a major donor. The building carries on the tradition established with Old Sem. This tradition is the use of classical elements in college architecture--a tradition followed up to the past decade. <br>

			<p>Extensive renovations were compleated in 2003</p>
