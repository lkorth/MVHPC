The site includes information on individual structures as well as some history of Mount Vernon. The design review section is there as a resource for residents who choose to participate in our exiting preservation efforts, as well as a explanation of expectations of historic property owners. There is information available for projects as big as an addition or a new paint job to projects as small as a new window sign or door.</font></p>
