C. W. Carley recalls a childhood experience of this time. Next
to Christmas it was the most exciting- day of the year in Mount Ver-
non-Cornell Commencement. Every street in town, every road far
out into the countrywas lined with horses and buggies. Main Street
was just like a carnival. S. ]. W. Carley let little Charlie and his
friend Burt Heath sell red lemonade in front of the Carley grocery
store, the present location of the B & N cafe. At the end of the day
the boys had literally a bushel basket of money-three~cent, five-cent,
ten-cent pieces in paper currency.
Among the civic leaders of _that day who have left lasting im-
pressions on the community was W. B. Armstrong, the father of
Frank Armstrong, who was later general manager of-the Reid, Mur-
dock firm of Chicago. His weather-beaten store on Main Street
furnished the genesis of a business career which led to the giving of
the present Armstrong Hall, beautiful pipe organs inthe Presby-
terian Church, and in the college chapel, the latter replaced by a larger
one presented by ll/Ir. and l\/Irs. Henry Pfeiffer.

nia, llday first, 1371 or i876 (the date is not clear) a Spanish priest,
one Gonzales hlontmorencie, advised a Spanish bishop, Nlontalvena,
a descendant of one of the oldest and wealthiest families in Spain,
that there was a large sum of money and diamonds buried 'in a village
of the state of Iowa. The money had been collected for the Church
of Rome. Brother l\dontalvena was entrusted “to find, dig up, and
dispose of this vast treasure." The following directions are' quoted:
“You will stop at a Hotel called Mt. Vernon House.
Kept hy a "Mr.. Guild”-nearly opposite this House is a
vacant lot--where the Treasure is Buried in an iron Box to
find it you will go to the Right Hand.Corner of this Lot
from the street feel at- the foot of the fence post and you will
find a pieec of wire. Leave it where it is now proceed down
the side of the fence, facing towards the clepo until you get
