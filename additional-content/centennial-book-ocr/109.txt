Let us take a look at the campus. The fence was gone, for an-
other pasture had been found for the college cows, but the wooden
sidewalks still remained-the same under which effigies of the Various
classes were once interred. The girls were as young as they are now,
but in long skirts, bustles, large hats, high collars and golf capes,
they would present an aged appearance to the present day bobby soxer,
clad in blue jeans and plaid shirt. And in comparison with the long
bob of the present day certainly many years were added by the Psyche
knots atop the heads of the`co~eds at the turn of the century.
_ The social life of Cornell centered around the literary societies
which had for' many years offered practically all the training in Eng-

and 90’s buggies and wagons filled with country folk would start
Corning to town in the very early morning hours just to get a Conven-

ferred, because it was well known that .actual hearers and critics
would b_e few, owing to the noise of the crowd standing around the
comparatively few people lucky enough to get seats.
The high school students,_ too, prior to receiving their diplomas
