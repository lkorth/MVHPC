194 ` HISTORY or MOUNT VERNON
It is along way from the old stoneboat trail to our paved streets
and highways, a long way from the underbrush and prairie grass to
our trimmed lawns and maple-shadedcampus, a long way from .Dan
Ha.hnâ€™s log cabin to our beautifull residences of present day Mount
Vernon. Five generations have rubbed elbows with the changes of
the century, and many, many people have ministered to its needs and
contributed to its progress.
