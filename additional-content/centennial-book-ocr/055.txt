With the election of President__Abraharn Lincoln in 1860 the
South was aroused to sudden and determined action, Beginning on
December 20, 1860, the states seeeded one by one, organized the con-
federacy, and opened fire on Fort Sumter April 12, 1861. _ __
On April 15th the President issued a callfor 75,000 troops for
ninety-day service. War Governor Kirkwood on April 17th` then
called- for a full company of seventy-eight men.from Linn County.
The feeling in Mount Vernon, with a population-numbering 760, was
intenseand by' noon of April 19th, 35 men had signed a muster roll.

27. were acceptedfor the firstcompany from Linn County, the re-
mainder were placed ina second regiment.; - _

Charles A. l’age,`a Cornellian _of 1856 and editor of the “Mount
Vernon News” _for two years, who became a famous Civil War cor-
respondent, speaking in generaliterms of the feeling toward the con-
flict at the time considered it “an error to say thatrnen were eager
for the fray, they Went rather 'with something like solemnity, cheer-
fully determined and earnest.” _, ' - _
Hard times had struck the state of Iowa and the college in 1857,
but the spring of 1861 seemed to promise better times. The issues
of the coming struggle werefully discussed and understood. In May
and November of 1855 and April 1856, four debate questions argued
in the Iowa Con-ference Seminary Club Society indicated the students
were alive to the dangers of disunion. ' _  
I. Resolved: “That the signs of the times indicate a dissolution
of the Union.” - _ '  
-ll. “That the present political spirit agitating the people of= the
United States is orninouseof evil to our government ;"
III. “That the dissolution of the Union would be favorable
to the North” (negative winning) ; and IV. “That a state has a right
to secede from the Union" (another decision for the negative).
The first regiment sent out had a company from Linn County
and one-third of the names on its- muster rolls were Cornell boys.
The first full company to go from this township into the three years
service also had one-third of its membership from Cornell College;
