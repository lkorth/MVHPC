CIVIL WAR' DAYS 57
many suffered patiently, and a number were taken prisoners. The
long list of veterans’ names in the Appendix tells very little of the
sufferings of those men who laid their all on the altar of patriotism.
Levi Mason, (Quartermaster), father of Doctor Kate Mason
Hogle, served until July 1863, came home ill and died.
William Warren, father of Mrs. John J. Smyth and Charles
Warren, died of malaria on the hospital boat "Nashville," leaving, as
did so many others, a brave wife and lonely children to fight the
battle of life without him. _
' Dr. Amos Witter, our surgeon, diedfrom ezihaustion on his re-
turn home for afurlough, after days and nights of caring for the
wounded at Forts Henry and Donelson. William Hayzlett gave all
three of his sons to the cause. _Edward (Sergeant), wounded July 21,
1864 near Atlanta, died August 14-th near_ Marietta; Richard,
wounded at Wilson’s Creek, died of Wounds and disease contracted
in the army, while Joseph, _wounded at Corinth, also died from
wounds.
Of chaplains Mount Vernon gave ‘her share: Charles W. Cole-
man, l. K. Fuller, James A. Wilson, and John Hogarth Lozier of the
Thirty-Seventh Indiana. Chaplain Lozier’s lecture on “Your Moth-
er’s Apron Strings” delighted large audiences over the country. With
pathos and humor he painted the scenes of camp life 'and war, in-
fluencing lives for Christian living. "
Then too there were Colone1.Robert Smyth, paymaster in the
army and a member of the Territorial Legislature, and the State
Senate; also Colo_nel H. H. Rood, elected president of Crocker’s
Brigade and for forty-eight years secretary of the Board of Tnistees
of Cornell College. He shared with Captain Charles W. Kepler the
duties of orator of the day in patriotic rallies. At one of the meetings
of the Twenty-Fourth Iowa held at Mount Vernon, Albert M. Floyd
and Jasper Bloom questioned the source of the pay for the -hand-
eighty-five dollars. “Right here,” answered the former Captain
as he made out his personal check. He had been severely wounded at
Corinth and was with difficulty saved from capture and death by _the
heroism of Edwin R. Mason and John B. i\"lcClaslrey of his company,
who 'risked their own lives in taking him f_rom the field.
Brigadier General Granville Moody of the Seventy-Fourth
Ohio Infantry was satisfied to spend the last years of his life in the
home of his son-in-law and daughter, Dr. and Mrs. Hugh Boyd, and
of his own choice lies in our cemetery. '
Some special mention should be made ofthe man who hore the
most scars from battle in Company A, J. N. Easterly. Wounded six
