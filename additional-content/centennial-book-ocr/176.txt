156 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
to accommodate all who wished to attend church services. The seat-
ing capacity of the church was 550; the membership numbered 570.
At that time, the college required all students' to' attend church ser-
vices on Sunday, so the official board appointed a committee to study
the whole situation and to report its findings six months later. The
Board voted to build a new church large enough for fifty years to
come. When the final vote was taken, and the figure of $25,000 was
announced as an estimate, the revered pastorbroke forth with a loud
hallelujah and began to sing in his lusty musical voice, “I love Thy'
Church, O God,” in which the Church Board joined. The building
committe was the pastor, E. B. Willix, Chairman: E. R. Ristine,
Secretary; W. F. King, William Smith, H. H. Rood, W. I-I. Norton,
C. W. Kepler, Dr. ]. B. Robinson, ]ohn~ Leigh, and George Young.
$17,500 was soon raised to start the work. `
Soon after _the farewell meeting in the old church the work of
razing the old church structure was begun. George A. Cramer, a
noted church architect of New York City, was employed to design
the new church, and the job of construction was let to john R. Gier of
Conrad, Iowa. He purchased the salvaged brick and lumberfrom
the old building and donated them to the church. The four pillars
near the four corners of the auditorium are made of salvaged brick.
Hence the old church supports the trusses that bear up the roof of
the present building. All the brick not so used went into the inner
layer of the walls. The walls from the foundation to the water table
consist of stone from the Mount Vernon quarry; the rest of the stone
came from Stone City, Iowa. From the drafts of the architect every
stone was shaped, dressed, and marked in the quarry, so no broken
rock was left on the ground. '
The corner stone was laid October 20, 1899. The services were
conducted by Doctors Thomas Nicholson, Hugh Boyd, and ]. B.-AL
brook, President, Wm. F. King, and the "pastor, Homer C. Stuntz.
The Reverend A. K. Knox represented the Presbyterian Church. Of
this goodly number of devout churchmen, not one is living.
On December 15, the capstone was set.on the north gable. The
church was completed at a total cost of $36,588.10 and was dedi-
cated June 6, 1900. '
A severe fire from an over-heated furnace on January 6, 1924,
damaged the interior of the church. The northern half of the base-
ment was then excavated, the kitchen and the lecture room enlarged,
the church redecorated and new lighting and heating plants installed
at a total cost of $21,611.76
In 1915 the old parsonage, which had been moved to Third
Street and Sixth Avenue North was sold for $2,200 and the money
applied to building a new minister’s home just west of the present
church on a lot purchased from William Oglebay. The new struc-
