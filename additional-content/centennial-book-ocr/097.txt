ance Cause. After his violent death, his widow came to llffount Ver-
non to put her children through college, buying the house later re-
modeled by Payson Peterson and now owned by ll/Ir. and Mrs. _Tames
MeCutcheon. She ran this as a boarding and rooming house for
Cornell students. Mrs. Iorns devoted herself to the Cause, stand-
ing staunchly with the Ol_d Guard of the W.C.T.U. Mrs. Mary F.
Williams, believing in uniting the two factions, was made editor of
the State organ, “The Champion,” and she filled that office with skill
and courage for five years. Under the leadership of these two gifted
women the W.C.T.U. of Mount Vernon became a powerful organ-
ization, giving programs and Temperance Teas which were widely
attended. Prominent speakers such as Frances Willard and Mrs. ].
Ellen Foster were brought in. -
Twenty citizens of the town went to the inaugural ceremonies of
the \Vorld’s Fair in Chicago in l\'Iay 1392. President King of the
college was chairman of an important committee at the Fair. It is
estimated that 27,000,000 people from all over the nation came to
marvel at the wonders of the Columbian Fountain, the White City,
the glittering Midway, and the mammoth steam-powered Ferris
Wheel with capacity of over twenty-one hundred people. Chicago's
Masonic Temple twenty-two stories _high is popularly supposed to

The panic of 1893 did not come with sensational suddenness as
did the market crash of 1929, but crept like a slow paralysis over the
land, closing banks, factories and business houses withthe inevita-
bility of doom. Soon there were 574 closed banks and 15,000 com-
mercial failures. Prices went down, down; Iowa hogs were quoted
below $2.50 a hundred~weight; and good horses went as low as $20
each. Drought cut thecorn crop in half, and coal strikes added to
the misery. Armies of unemployed were loose in the land, homeless
and desperate. Most famous of these in Iowa was Kelly’s Army of
a thousand men armed only with tin plates and cups, which came on
foot from San Francisco to Des l\/Ioines, where they occupied an
abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city. Since the railroad re-
fused them passage, the people of Des Moines had to build them
rafts on which Kelly's Army floated off down the river.
Mount Vernon had her share of these wandering hoodlums. In
1894 a mass meeting was called for the purpose of ridding the town
of “boot-leggers” and “criminals” Charley Carley and Pete Ink re-
member that some citizens of Mount Vernon and vicinity were sus-
pected of aiding a gang of horse-thieves, although they were never
brought to trial. The hiding place of the stolen horses was thought
to have been down on Coon Creek near the mill.
This panic was popularly blamed on President C1eveIand’s low'
tariffepolicy which allowed foreign goods to come into competition
