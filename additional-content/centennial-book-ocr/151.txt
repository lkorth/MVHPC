untiring efforts of llvlrs. Louis Herrick Who' spent endless time in
building up the departments.

ecutive"bo_ard of the NIother’s Club met at the f-honrie of 3the'Presiderit,

meet the needs of the school as well. The Club had been founded _three
years previouslywyith l\f{rs. Howard Johnston =as its_ 'first president.
