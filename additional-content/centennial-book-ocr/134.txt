116 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
_ ' While the new building was going up, the junior-high and high
school convened in the basement of the Methodist Church. Some
classes met in the parish house. The following year, on May 11, 1927,
the Grand Lodge of Iowa laid the corner stone of the new high
school building. ‘
ln September 1927, under Superintendent Earl J. Stout and
Principal Seville Gaston the pupils and teachers of Mount Vernon
started a new era of high school education in the history of the town.
In contrast with the creaky stairway and the crowded classrooms of
the old building and the dim light of the basement of the l\/Iethodist
Church were the broad stairways and wide corridors of the new
structure, the large classrooms, and the brightness of everything new.
Modern Trends, 1927-1947
Mount Vernon has played the role of a modern school in the last
twenty years. Mathematics, social science, English and science have
been fundamental courses in the curriculum. Practice teaching on
the part of students from Cornell was introduced in 1930.
Extra-curricular activitieshave become increasingly prominent.
Since 1929 the "Chalk Mark" in the Hawkeye has held the interest
of those inclined toward journalism. The "Velvet Curtain” has
sponsored many a dramatic production. In 1917, 1926, 1942, and
1946 yearbooks were published. Football, basketball, and track with
their accessories of _baton twirlers, pep stunts and cheer leaders have
welded a strong school spirit. In music the school has taken part in
district, state, and national music festivals-girls’ glee clubs, boys’
glee clubs, mixed chorus, band, orchestra, sextets, and soloists having
appeared regularly. The large glass -case in the hallway of the high
school is full of all kinds of trophies. 9' ,
A noticeable brealcfrom a long-accepted tradition in our com-
munity occurred in the l930’s. Social dancing was introduced.
Through the years we had not been quite so narrow as they were back
in the 1370's when the Hawkeye published the following suggestions
to boys: “lf you dance well and want exercise, exhibit your graces in
your father’s back yard or out on the lawn by yourself.” However,
the most particular people did not go to dances. Now dancing was
not only approved of but taught in our schools.
It may be well at this point of the sketch to conclude the story
of the commencement dresses of the girl graduate. By the 193O’s
simplicity was the key word. The girls wore plain tailored white
dresses when they were given their diplomas. In ’38 the key word
was uniformity. Caps and gowns became the vogue. Now the school
owns its own beautiful, maroon capsand gowns for the 'events of
graduation week. ' ` 7 '
