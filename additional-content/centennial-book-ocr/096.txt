90 HISTORY:-OF 'MOUNT VERNON
pitched their tents on _the .edge of town, .chanting the praise of
'Kickapoo Indian Sagwa, arernedy guaranteedto “Cure your illstfrom
corns to spotsbefore the eyes.”
Ads indicative _of the times were the oft-repeated one “A few
good over-coats in exchange for wood at Charles Braeketts," and one
from Neff7s furniture store ,which _ran every _week in 1895: “The
telephone to the depot ‘is .now in fine _working order and _saves many
steps-and _precious momen`ts.of time, all for 'five-cents.” _As -it was
the.-only -telephone in town, its use was strictly =1irn'ited tto--calling the
depot and 'longdistance =until.l900. _
' -Much good-natured joking took place 'betweenthe newspapers. of
neighboring towns. This 'bit of humor -from "the 'Springville New
‘Era _is "typical: -“A woman in 'M_ount Vernon said -that .she had _three
Iehildren, two of -them are still "living and the third-Tis iniljisbon.”
_ 'ln Mount Vernon, as 'in -the country as a whole, _this was a dec-
ade of expansion _and modernization. 'With the coming of Charles
Heller in 1891 a building boom began which -_changed the face of
Main Street and added a great many buildings _on the-north side of
town, where a swamp -had -been drained :to -make -IOOHI f01' several
blocks of houses. Accordingto a story in the Hawkeye in 1892, a
total of twenty-five new residences was completed in that -year _at 8
cost o`f_$50,000. This amou-nt seems unbelievablyilow until we realize
that the daily wage _for carpenters and masons was $1.50 for a _-ten-
hour day, except for the most 'skilled,- who received an additional
dollar.
_ In the Hawkeye of 1893 under “Seasonis Story” .-is an account
of 25 new buildings being erected at an expenditure .of $23,000.
Then follows an itemized list of homes built, of which the following
are typical: Dr. Mason ‘Hogle,_`6 rooms, $`1200; Mr. Lemon, 7 rooms,
$1500; :Mrs. Keediek, 7 rooms, $l500, and a barn $200; 'Ely West,
S rooms, with buttery, wash-iroom, closets, and wood shed; 552200.
Although thttt tttivttt and public btti1s_ittgt,,`ittt1ut1ittg 'tht .two
churches, were well built, they lacked the architectural beauty of the
brick houses built thirty or forty years earlier.
The burning issue of the times was Temperance. Not only was
there bitter wttfatt between the wet and dry forces of the State, but
within the ranks ofthe W.C.T;-U. .there wtte f21_CtiOI1S Whifrh threaten'
_ed to disrupt the organization. The new order wanted to join forces
with the new Prohibition party; the old guard opposed such union.
In Mount Vernon the feeling raneso high' th_at the Methodists refused
the use of their church to speakers of both factions. In many places
in- Iowa, esp_ecially around Clinton and Sioux City, mobs represent-

Such was the fate of _Iarnes lorns, a valiant crusaderin the Temper-
