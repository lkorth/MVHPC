CORNELL UNDER WILLIAM FLETCHER KING S1
` H. H. Freer of the class of 1869 is first listed as a student in
Preparatory 'Classical course in the_ catalog of 1863-’64. One year
his name is missing, and' then in 1870-’71 he enters again as a tutor in
the preparatory department and in charge of the college library. For
nearly half a century his name' continues in the faculty list with a
growing influence and responsibility. Finally Dean Freer emerges
as the idol of a host of alumni, in demand as a speaker in alumni
groups wherever Cornellians gathered together. _
Among the influential faculty members who served under Presi~
dent King were Alonzo Collin,_ builder of “Collin House" on_ the
campus hilltop, who was professor of Mathematics and Science
(Physics and Chemistry) for forty-six years; Hugh Boyd, Professor
of Greek and Latin from 1871 to 1906, who has become almost a
legendary figure because of the tall tales which record his wit and his
originality as a teacher and acting-president; S. N. Williams for
forty-one years Professor of Engineering and for almost twenty years
librarian as well. As a member of the town council he was a 'moving
spirit in getting street lamps, water-works and a sewage system in-
stalled in Mt. Vernon. Dr. Thomas Nicholson, later Bishop Nich-
olson, left a strong imprint on the spiritual life of his students and
through them on far-distant places where they went as missionaries
and church leaders. Dr. James Harlan who served as vice-president
under Dr. King for twenty-seven years before he was inaugurated
President in 1908, will be accorded his place in Cornell history in a
later chapter.
It seemed fitting in 1904 to recognize the conclusion of fifty
years of successful operation of the college. A substantially enlarged
commencement occasion was planned for June 1904, the events lasting
through one week. Persons of national fame and importance were
present, such as Bishops Andrews and Berry of the :Methodist Church
who preached sermons; and Bishop William F. McDowell of the
Church who made an address. The editor of the Christian Advocate,
James M. Buckley, Secretary Shaw of the President’s Cabinet, Lern-
uel Murlin, President of Boston University, Senator Edgar T. Brac-
kett, Edward T. Devine of New York City, Charles   Little, Presi-
dent of Garrett Biblical Institute, and many others were among the
guests who had parts in the program.,
It may be of interest to our realers to have the following excerpt
from the proceedings of that commencement. An oil portrait of
President King was presented to the college by the brother of the ar-
tist, l\/Ir. Jurgenson. James E. Harlan, then vice-president of the
college, accepted the portrait, saying: u
In October 1863 a youth ascending the slopes of the Cedar '
reached the top of this beautiful Mount Vernon hill making
application to be received as a student. He well remembers the
impression made upon him by that strong, kindly, intellectual
man whose portrait is before you. The most intimate relations
