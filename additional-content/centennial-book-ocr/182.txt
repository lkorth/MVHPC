152 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
The Literary Societies were still active during President Har-
lan’s term of office. ` They were the Amphictyon, Adel-phian, Milton-
ian, Zetagathian (Star) and Parrnenian for men; the Philornathean,
Aesthesian, Alethean, Aonian, Promethean and Thalian for women.
In spite of former action by the Board of Trustees banning national
fraternities from the campus, a sub-rosa chapter of Sigma Nu was- in
existence. The question came to a head when several members of the
senior class of 1913 were refused graduation because of membership in
such forbidden fraternities. It is felt that the college was wise in tal:-
ing its place with the group of small colleges without fraternity affil-
iations. '-Local groups for both men and women have played a more
or less prominent place in the social life of the school on down to the
present. '
Dr. Charles W. Flint became Cornell’s fifth president on Nov.
19, 1915. He gave sane and progressive leadership during the diffi-
cult years of the First World War. During his administration the
new heating plant was completed in 1916, the swimming pool (gift
of the classes ’l6 and ’17) was finished in 1917, Altoona Hall ac-
quired in 1918, Rood House was presented by the class of ’94 at the
Commencement of 1919, a considerable sectionof cement bleachers
was erected in 1921 and extensive improvements made on llfiain Hall,
the Chapel and Bowman Hall.. Conditional offers of $500,000 by
the General Educational Board, $75,000 by the Carnegie Corpora-
tion and $50,000 by the Carnegie Foundation- were secured in 1920-
21. The gift of vast wheat fields in Canada, incorporated as the Em-
mett Foundation, seemed to even the wisest advisers to be a great boon
but turned out disastrously for the college. After costly attempts at
colonization, the land was sold at a great loss years later.
i The Cornell Bulletin of Bday 15, 1922, states that during Dr.
Flint’s presidency “curriculum changes kept the course-of-study up-
to-date and practical without sacrificing fundamental cultural value.”
Group requirements were revised, a “major” system introduced, the
Home Economics department was organized in 1917, the Carnegie
Annuitysplan adopted in 1921 and the Public Speaking department
added in 1922.
Following Dr. Flint’s resignation to become Chancellor of Syra-
cuse University, Dr. William S. Ebersole became interim acting
president in 1922-’23, with Dr. J. R. VanPelt, Ir., and Miss°Alice
Betts on his administrative committee. Their objective was to “hold
the line” during that year of depression, with the increasing anxiety
felt about the outcome of the Emmett Foundation. Because of his
splendid judicial qualities and administrative gifts Dr. Ebersole was
called upon three times to administer college affairs, between the ad-
ministrations of Harlan, Flint, Updegraff 'and Burgstahler. In addi-
tion to these important services he was author of numerous classical
