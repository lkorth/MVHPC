capable of deep treachery__ by night. There were,_the_flowered_ car-
pets that had to take a terrific beating at spring-cleaning time, of
matting tacked ,down over layers ofnewspapers or straw, of bamboo
portieres, or others made of ]ob’s Tears from the garden strung on
colored cords. It was the time of the peacock feather fan, of the old-
fashioned square churn, _of the zinc-lined bath tub, and other items
which have vanished from the modern scene; - _
Music and oratory flourished throughoutthe nineties. Letter-
writing, too, was a fine art far removed from the hasty scrawls, and
the “dictated butnot read” notes of our time. _ Not only was there a
number of ladies of the town who took part regularly in therecitals
of a music_ club, but there was a famous band known as the Military
Band, or the Silver Comets," which' kept Mount Vernon on' the
musical map. 'They were at their peak during theyears ’88 to ’93,
when under the direction of_ Horace Lozier, they made many out-
of-town appearances. _Among these engagements were programs at
the horse ,races at Independence, at the Odd _Fellows Founders’ day
at Tipton-in ’93, at a political rally at Cedar Rapids, and at a Fourth
of July celebration at Clinton. They played _often at Literary So-
ciety ‘f_publics",_ (contests inf oratory) in the chapel, These would be
attendedby the whole t0Wn.._ _Oi the twenty _members in the Band

events occurred- in the year 1899 soon after his appointment. First
of these .was the May lVIusic Festival on-May- 17, 18 'and l9._ This
was described in the Hawkeye as' “the most elaborate affair ever held
in Mount Vernon or .the State.” . . _ “one thing on which the town
and college can join hands.” Through the generous backing of the
music _lovers of the community the ambitious plan was put over .with
the assurance that 800 tickets could be sold. Season tickets for the
five concerts were priced at one dollar, with fifty cents extra for a re-
served seat. A- chorus of one hundred trained voices presented the
“Swan and the Skylark” before _the first Festival audience. Visiting
artists were Genevieve Clark Wilson, soprano of Chicago; Arthur
Dunham, organist of Chicago; Bicknell Young, baritone from Chi-
