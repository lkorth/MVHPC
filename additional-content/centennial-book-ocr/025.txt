The Founding Of Cornell College
Mount Vern_on’s man of destiny, George B. Bowman, arrived in
1850,'when the village consisted ofa few cabins and twoor three
general stores. Pastor Bowman was descended from a German fam-
ily with a coat of arms. He put aside alluring offers of leading
churches in North Carolina in the forties, and came to_the land of
promiswthe West-as a home missionary in St. Louis. _His ability
was soon ‘recognized and he was transferred to Iowa City to build a
new church in the town destined to become a state capital. Money
was scarce; Bowman solicited instead all kinds of merchandise, and
opening a general store, sold it for cash, thus dedicating the new
churchwithin two years. _ ~ ~
After serving as presiding elder of the Dubuque District for
two years, and also of the Burlington District for three years, Bow-
man chose to come to Mount Vernon 'where there was not even a
church building. He was tall and spare, bronzed with the summer
suns and hardened by the snows of winter 'from his horseback rides
on the prairies. He was reserved, but full of faith and resourceful-
ness. “If God wills, it CAN and MUST be done," was the motto
of his life. When he spoke' his words warmed the hearts of hearers.
‘When he sang the good old songs, his congregation' seemed to catch
a glimpse of Heaven. For many years plans had been revolving in
his mind to consolidate the scattered charges around the hilltop. This
culminated in the building of the first brick church in 1850.
But now as he rode up on the hilltop, a greater vision allured
him. He felt the need of Christian education for his children, for _the
children of other pastors, and for all the community around. From
the hilltop view the tall grass of the boundless prairies waved its
shimmering benediction. To the south flowed, among the groves of
timber, the beautiful river which he so often crossed on the ferry.
Bishop Haven afterward declared the view to be the “loveliest lay of
land" on which he had ever looked. .
Surely God had created the hilltop for such an hour as this. The
voice of God was calling him, he felt, to build a college here. In vis-
ions of thefuture, he seemed to see the generations marchinguthrough
stately halls and _forth to bless the world. t
Traditionhas it that on this sacred spot he dismounted, and ty-
ing his horse to a nearby tree, knelt in a hazel thicker to pray.. f7Call
