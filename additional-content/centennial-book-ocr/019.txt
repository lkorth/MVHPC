A CHRONICLE OF TWO DECADES 21
“-Iowa. Her affections like the rivers of her borders, flow to an in-
separable Union.” _
~ 1847 ` '
Samuel Pfautz, granduncle of Mrs.-David West, took a job this
year north of Yankee Grove. I-Ie was the first of a long line of
Pfautzes who have meant so much to Lisbon. In ]u1y, 1847, Samuel
wrote to his mother back in Pennsylvania, “I_-let you know I am well.
I came to Burlington, then on a steamboat to Bloomington (Musca-
tine) and came on to Linn County. It is a fine delightfulicountry.
The land is rolling and dry. The timber is good. The Cedar River
is navigable for flatboats and keelboats. Steamboats can come up in
the spring. Fish are very plentiful in the Cedar. Pike weigh from
five to fifteen pounds, catfish from ten to thirty pounds. There are
salmon also. Land is $1.25 to $10 an acre and very rich. The soil
is five feet deep, good for any crop. Wheat, corn, oats, are good.
The timber -is full of wild fruits; thousands of plum trees are found,
and the trees are just as full as they can hang. There are strawberries
in ]une. Deer are numerous; also wild turkey and other game. I
like the country well. Coopering is good. There is fine stave wood
along the Cedar. Direct your letter to Ivanhoe.”
The above letter is interesting in reflecting the conditions of the
times. Envelopes were not used, but- letters were sealed and cost
twenty-five cents postage.
About this time l\fIount Vernon began to be called “Pinhook,”
from the wooden pins used in the stores to hang up the goods. Luke
Fish, the jeweler, bought Henry Chapman’s cabin this year; George
Edgerton put an addition on his cabin; and Stephen Cook, a quaint
character and violent speaker, had a blacksmith shop _where the Cen-
tral House afterward stood. There was a general store built northeast
of the intersection of Main Street and Military Road. C
_ At last the hour of destiny had arrived for which these lands and
this hilltop had waited. Mrs. Ada Sherwood tells us in the college
chapbook which she wrote that in the midst of- an ideal summer _.Al-
lison Willits rode out to _Tesse l-Iolman’s, the present Murton Kep-
ler farm, and took Jesse and family for a ride over the hilltop, which
was then without fences. He described glowingly the beauty of the
location and the possibilities of a college on the hilltop. A few days
later he took Richard __Harbert, the carpenter, together with George
Edgerton, Ackley Parker, and Robert Stinson, and laid out two blocks
of .lots west of the Military Road. _Iewett and Gourley proceeded
to sell the lots at $75 each. The survey, as recorded inthe Linn
County courthouse, was madepermanent by County Surveyor Andrew
Botdorff, February 24, 1849. The first 'house after the survey was
put up with logs _by_R, ]. _I-larbert and occupied by him in~Septernber,
