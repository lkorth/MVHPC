82 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
which followed have only served to strengthen the impressions
made upon the youth and the young man ashe continued his col-
lege course. The youth declares_ to you that he whose portrait I
now receive is a true man, a Wise counselor, an excellent advis-
or, a just judge.
Dr. William Ebersole sums up for us briefly the significant place
President King had in shaping the destiny of the college in the follow-
ing tribute:_
“The college did well, to unveil a portrait of President William
King for exhibit in her halls, and also to designate the chapel building
as a_ memorial to him. It is not surprising that many feel that- the
name ofthe college should be changed to his namefso great was his
contribution to the establishment and- development of' the institution
in the almost unequaled, length of his administration,
Dr. King was a manof scholarly habits,,a cultured gentleman of
the older school, a man of strong- convictions and high ideals, a genius
for conceiving and carrying out plans, a Wise counsellor, a wide trav-
eller, socially and intellectually at home with men prominent in edu-
cational and financial circles,_especially in the East- where our. high
rating continues to this day.
His sterling qualities were recogniz_ed by the State, Nation and
Church, so that he Was chosen for many important appointments.
Among these he served-on the council of the National Educational
Association of America, was Commissioner for Iowa on the World’s
Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893, delegate to the International
Congress, Paris, 1900, and to the Ecumenical l\/Iethodist Conference,
London, 1901. ' '
Successful in his private financial ventures, he contributedlib-
erally to the College. One of -hisgifts was the purchase, when in
Italy, of a_group of eight full-size copies of famous Greek and Roman
sculptures, done in the original marble or bronze, to be placed in the
College Halls as a cultural inspiration for the students. They now
adorn the Hall' of Fine Arts 'and the library building.
Another gift was an endowment to sustain IDU perpetual schol-
arships-one for each Iowa county-as amemorial to Mrs.. King.
Also he gave his beautiful home on the crest of the campus hill for the
use of future presidents. ' _ _ '
Dr. King’s extensive travels, including numerous trips to Europe,
brought him many valuable contacts which he turned to the advantage
of the college. As a fitting climax to his travel experiences he jour-
neyed round the world in 1910.
His book of over 700 pages, entitled “Reminiscences” is a re-
markable autobiography which marks him as a man of unusual talents
and accomplishments. Cornell owes much of her distinction to this
man who left his mark uponher during his long administration and
for all _time to come]  _ __
