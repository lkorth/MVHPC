In 1'903'”the merchantshad a, midwinter carnival for one Week
in the Odd Fellows’ Hall;   featured a curio room and' exhibits: of
art, -fancy work and baking." The main attraction was a' baby show.
Three old bachelors, W. V. Chambers, Harry Ellison and DeWitt
McClellan, whofperhaps- had never held a- baby, made, the- awards.
The prize, a sterling spoon, 'Wentto Hazel Hahn for being the best
natured. z Maggie Marta, daughter of Willis, recei*.ied"` a book- for
being the youngest Walker and talker." Sarah- Margaret Turner re-
ceived `a-gold ring 'for-having the strongest lungs. One-Wonders how

cry, or was-one look at the judges enough to bring- about this reaction?
Other babies exhibited-were Mary-E. Reynolds, Ruby M". Leigh, Vir-
gil Wilson, Maurice H’artung,_ Craig Boyd, and' Harriett Hoover.
All babies- received a- cup- and- saucer as at consolation. prize. The
judges wisely refrained, or lacked the nerve, to- name: the prettiest.
baby. ~- - -
