A CHRONICLE OF TWO DECADES 19
Ohio with a prairie schooner of goods and family and located at the
Hale Spring, north of the present' high school.
A post office was opened on the Robert Smyth farm. Mail
came once a week by horseback. _
'I 842
Henry Chapman built a cabin at the east end of Main Street.
John C. and W. H. Goudy and William Perkins settled near Linn
Grove, being the first of a-long line of influential Presbyterians.
Jesse Holman, son of a Revolutionary War doctor, an earnest Chris-
tian and abolitionist, bought from Robert Stinson 'the cabin north of
the present Hawkeye building, which was replace_d in 1855 by the
brick house known as the Ada Sherwood home. There were eleven
children in the family, among them a daughter, Mrs. Sherwood, who
became a teacher of Mount Vernon pupils for two generations. Mrs.
Holman, after the death of her husband jesse, delighted to go past the
school building, arrayed in her best black dress and white collar, so
promptly at closing hour of school that she came to be called "Grand-
ma Four O’c1ock.” . '
Horse thieves were so common that settlers had to keep their
barns locked at night. Notably, the Brodies were the tough gang
who stole from cabins and broke up social dances. They came from
the deep woods over by Linn Grove. They broke into the Goudy
cabin over north, at night, brandishing a gun and demanding the
$9000 Mr. Goudy had brought from the East. They found only
$120 in a pocket book and went on to rob the neighbors. Later the
vigilantes got two of the gang and flogged them on their bare backs
until they fainted. There was not much government but plenty of
rude justice in these prairies and woods.
1843
e It is startling to read that like most communities of that day,
th_e first business enterprise was a saloon operated by Harvey Jewett.
The citizens, however, by moral suasion, induced him -to change to a
general store. Lewis Turner also opened a store on the south side
of Main Street. It was about next door to where the Kepler build-
ing now stands.
The Cedar River became a highway for flatboats bound for St.
Louis. Robert Stinson and William Perkinsrafted S00 bushels of
corn from Ivanhoe, disposed of it and the raft, and walked back.
]ames McClelland 'rafted 3000 bushels of wheat to New Orleans in
order to get better _prices than offered at St. Louis. It is said that
he bought sugar for three cents a pound and sold it back home for
twelve cents. Coffee costing seven centsa 'pound he sold for seven-
teen. 'i With this return load it is safe to infer that he did not Walk.
