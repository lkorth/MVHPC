THE TURN or THE CENTURY 103
The beginning of the twentieth century _sawthe passing of sev-
eral Mount Vernon enterprises, among them the stone quarry and ].
B. Robinson’s brick yard and ice business. In 1900 W. H. Goudy
sold the last of his stock to the Fair Store in Cedar Rapids, and in
1903 Gilbert Rundell, familiarly lmown as “Gib”, sold his meat mar-
ket to his brother G. A. Rundell.
The early years of the century saw also the passing of men long
prominent in business: James (Merchant) Smith, Elijah L. Guild,
Stewart Ellison and others. lt is fitting to mention here the name
of Mrs. Emma Witter I-Iutson, who for thirty-seven years was' a
milliner in Mount Vernon. She holds the' woman’s record for the
longest period of time on Main Street. Nelia Kyle, also will be long
remembered as the town’s first woman real estate agent. She was a
lively competitor of George Border. ` ,
One cannot leave this period without mention' of Henry F.
Byers, who left Mount Vernon about 1912. "Hen’s” geniality and
good food made his restaurant the student center of that time. Even
the famous cartoonist, John T. McCutcheon, on a visit to Cornell,
saw fit to portray in the course of his lecture, the students rushing in
to “Hen’s.” _ f
New faces were appearing in Mount Vernon, however, and new'
industries which were destined to take theplace of the old. ' The
_town council decided to sell the unusedalleys to adjacent owners and
thus enrich the town treasury. A beginning was made of macadamiz~
ing the main streets, and a new steel bridge was built over the short
line at the east and of Main Street. The cemetery was almost doubled
in size by buying the hill to the south and east. In 1901 the Citizens’
State Bank was organized with the following officers: President, M.
F. Rigby; Vice-President, Clem Falcon; Cashier, O. I. Sweet. The
directors were C. P. Whittemore, W. B. Munson and   F. Kill-
heffer.
A laundry was also started which did the work for town and
college for several years. Ralph Kirltpatrick's feed mill on First Ave-
nue ground grain. *
April 27, 1900, the first weather signal service was inaugurated
by “Dad” Davis. The weather flags were run up by him on a high
pole in front of Horton & Kyle’s Shoe Store. Prior to the advent of
radio, this Was a valued service. Speaking of weather on Sunday af-
ternoon _lune 7, 1908,'fo1-ty-eight years after our first devastating
tornado, a second one passed south of Mount Vernon, almost de-
stroying the barn on the Ira Barnes’ place and doing a great deal' of
damage in Lisbon, especially to the power plant. `
At this time it is interesting to note that Otis Kepler advertised
for rent a five room house for $8.50 a month and a six room house for
$10.00 a month. Mr. H. G.`Simpson was offering one year old
peach trees for 10c apiece and two year old ones for 15c. Other prices
were in accordance. Ice cream cones which were offered in Mount
