The Twentieth Century. A Second Addition _to the
` High School. The New Ward Sshqnl
The first decade _of the _twentieth century showed _rapid expan-
Siim in the building program- 'The second addition tc-the schoolhouse
Was Voted on in March, -1902. This _consisted of .two more rooms
added on the northeast side of -the original brick of 1867, one on the
lower and one on the upper floor. It wasuat this time also that a
ro_om in the northwest-9 corner of the basement was remodeled and dec-
orated for the first kindergarten. l\'Iiss Katherine Rush was the first
kindergarten teacher.
In 1906 our school board looked for a site for a new schoolhouse,
which would take care of the kindergarten and the first six grades.
It was found on Third Avenue and Fourth Street, North, a place
known as the Ink property. This was a good location because it was
away from Main Street. ° The cost of thi_s brick house with its two
lots was $1l75. At little expense the house was prepared for im-
mediate use for thesixth grade. I_n 1908 it was necessary- to put
the 'third and fourth grades on the upper floor of this building. For
the next three years three grades were accommodated in this old
brickehouse. - - ' '
The necessity of a ward school was so generally felt that there
was scarcely any opposition in -t-he district in the spring of 1911 when
the question was voted upon. The total -cost of the new building
was $19,500. Dr. Alexander- Crawford, president, W. H. Dodd,
Charles Maybauer, Dr. T. I. Gqrnlly, and M. K. Neff were the
members of the-board who carried on the building program. In
April, 1912 the public proudly inspected' the new gradebuildingf

Not only Was the t0Wn improving in its school buildings,‘but
also it was greatly strengthening its educational system. In 1903
the board elected its first music teacher, Miss Florella Goudy. In
1904 the twelfth grade was added, and Mount Vernon became a
fully accredited high school. In 1908 the board created the office of
superintendent of schools. Mr. Payson Peterson was the first super-
intendent of Mount Vernon schools._ He served here longer than
any other superintendent, twelveyears altogether. The following
incident is typical of the way' he handledhis disciplinary problems.
It was a rnonotonous afternoon in the spring of 1908. The last
bell had rung for school. _ All of M.V.H.S. had_ settled down to work;
that is, all but Bob and Bill. They Were 'bound on a truant’s flight
