History ls
At Bindery
" Has Been Work Of
Nearly Two Years
Unique in centennial celebrations
of Iowa cities is the one of Mount
Vernon, publication of “A- Centen-
nial History of Mount Vernon,
Iowa," in book form. `
The 260 page book is now all
printed and is in the hands of the
binder, Henry L. Feiereisen, of Ced-
ar Rapids.
The first copy was received this
week 'by the committee who have
labored for many hours on the book.
They are highly pleased with the re-
sult. The book is 'bound in blue
cloth-with gold lettering on the front
and backbone. _ _
The History has 224 pages of text
with 40 pages of historic pictures in-
cluding a section on historical
homes. _ i
__ Conceived by the Bev.  . V.
Williams, the project got under
way slowly in the fall of No-
vember 1946.
- Rev. Williams urged the Chamber
of Commerce to get behind the pro-
ject. The Chamber invited other
town organizations to join and a
committee was selected to take
charge of the big job which includ-
ed Mae .Pi Hutchinson, Florence
Keyes Mitchell, Nellie M. Hartung,
~S. V. Williams, Geraldine Hughes
and Frederick M. McGaw. ,
The idea of a centennial ob-
' servation thatwould have some
"pennauent value rather than a
big “day” with carnival etc.,
appealed to everyone. ' `
A business committee of R. B.
Wolfe, chairman, Jay Fordyce,_sec-
retary-treasurer, Corlyn Bauman
and James McCutcheon took charge
of the financial and mechanical end
of the project.
` The idea was to write ,the history
of the _first century before all of the
old timers died and it would be dif-
ficult to obtain the information.
Sponsors were sought who would
guarantee $10 each and receive
three copies of the book. Rev. Wil-
liams sent out cards and letters to
former residents. This resulted in 97
local sponsors with -14 non-resident
sponsors whose names _appear in
the book. ._ _
- Writing of the text took nearly ,a
year. Setting the type and- printing'
of the book took abouteight months
as _itf had to be -worked in along
with the regular work at the Hawk-
eye office. '
The final result will soon be avail-
able when the binder finishes his
work. He, like the printer, cannot
make any Dlfomise but will complete
it as soon as possible.
The preface states that “Members
of the Committee have collaborated
on each chapter and have carefully
edited each one. Many letters have
been written, many calls made and
much research work has been done.
"Great credit must be given to
S. Y_ Williams in whose ind the
idea was conceived and “mcse en-
thusiasm gave the impetus to the
committee and launched it on_ its
work. To him credit must be given
also for much of the research work
and the general plan of the book.
The actual writing of the book
has been done by the Committee and
by Mary L. Parsons who wrote
World War II, Elizabeth B. Ink who
authored “Farms and Farmlng”, and
Elmer J. Miller who wrote World
War I. ` '
Pictures were borrowed from nu-
merous individuals and many histor-
ic cuts in~th_e Hawkeye files were
used. Joseph Bennett helped- with
the research work and Charles Paul
loaned his grandmothers letters
which make a very interestlngchap-
tex; of the book. '-
These letters, written from 1854
to 1863, by Mrs. Benjamin Ford, an
early settler, in Mt; Vernon, to her
parents and sisters in New York
give a "vivid, first-hand, sometimes
home-sick picture of life on the
prairies in the fifties and early six-
ties.” f ' _
The committee is very grateful to
the sponsors W hose guarantee of $10
each madeit possible to go ahead
with the writing and printingof the
History. _
The first copies willbe sent to the_
out-of-town sponsors. It wil.l`prob-
ably be some time in August before
the binder completes his work.
Itnow appears that only about
'15 copies remain for sale .to in-
dividuals. It is suggested that
anyone who wants s. copy should
notify Miss Nellie Hlrtung, dial
6311 at once. '
From the interest shown it ap-
pears very likely that the extra
copies will soon be sold. Miss Har..
mg has a samplebook which IIQB'
who is interested may sw.
