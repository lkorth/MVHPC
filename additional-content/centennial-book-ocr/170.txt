150 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
The climax of all these labor-saving devices was the bountiful
centennial harvest of 1946, a favorable season doing its part. Corn
averaged 53 bushels to the acre, with record yields of 108, 114, and
120 bushels per acre. ln 184-6, the price Was fifteen cents a bushel,
and in 1946 it was $1.01. Soy beans averaged 25 bushels per acre
and brought a price of $3.28 a bushel. Some __f_i_elcls__,_averaged__ 40
bushels. Oats Were 75 .cents, $1.00 for a time, a bushel, and averaged
from 20 to 80° bushels per acre. Clinton was the preferred type.
Alfalfa produced three tons an acre; raspberries and strawberries
Were picked as late as November, and the corn harvest Was completed
before the first snow in mid-December. Truly the place of the farm-
er in our national life has become outstanding in every vvay. The wide
varieties of fruits grown, read like a nurseryman’s catalog-apples,
plums, pears, peaches, apricots, cherries, strawberries, currants, rasp-
berries, black berries, and grapes.
Invention has greatly added to the conveniences of the farm.
Party rural telephone lines were constructed in 1905, and Phil Stinger
gave a neighborhood concert over the line with his phonograph.
There was a rural switchboard in the Foster Leigh home. It is no-
ticeable that when dial phones were installed in 1939, our hflount
Vernon community Was the first rural community in the entire United
States selected for the trial. Leisure time, comfort, and luxuries of
every kind in equipment came to farm life with the advent of eleel
tricity on the farm after the first world war. Now with the R.E.A.
days are lengthened for farm chores, and household tasks become easy
with such facilities.
The Rural Free Delivery caught the imagination of the entire
nation, when it was introduced in 1902. Then it was that the city
began to Want to move to the farm. “Te pay our tribute to those
pioneering, hard working rural carriers, Gordon Hess, Sol Geiger and
Fred Blaine. That movement speeded up greatly the coming of all-
Weather, hard surfaced roads. _
Greater even than the progress in material things has been the
widened horizon of farm life in things of the mind and spirit. Men-
tion has been made of the early school houses: the little red school
house known as the Iackson school was moved to the farm of Charles
Platner; the Ivanhoe school taught by George Green (]'udge} ; the
Cedar Valley school at St. Mary’s Crossroads, two miles south; the
Buckslcin school taught by Elizabeth Bennett at Linn Grove, were
well known. _
The red-brick Abbey school house where Elder Bowman preach-
ed every month is novv changed into a home. We mention also the
Standing Rock school house by Stony Point with pupils from Cedar,
Johnson, and Linn counties. “Book-learning” was hastened by pi-
