successful operation. They are eminen_tly adapted to promote cor-
rectness of thought, extent of information and improvement in speak-
ing and Writing." By 1860 there were three such societies in “suc-
cessful operation”--a number which had grown to eleven in 1926327
when they were last mentioned in a college catalog. Many of the
readers of this history remember the four yvell-furnished rooms on
the third floor of Main Hall which were the official homes of the
societies for many years. The men’s societies met regularly on Friday
night and the girls’ on Saturday night.. e
Shortly before his death Dr. William Norton presented Dr.
Frank Brooks with the original “Record Book of the Club--A Lit~
erary Society of the Iowa Conference Seminary, Organized Febru-
ary the Fourth 1854-.” On the fly-leaf is the notation “Given to
Nl. A. B. Witter by Kate Putnam Carter, July lst, l902." In it
were recorded the minutes of the Club from its founding until the
last entry for June 16th, 1859. ln addition 'to the regular duties of
office, the president was required to “read an Essay on some subject
worthy the attention_ of the Club," the secretary was to “Warm and
light the room suo sumtio during his term" and the critic to “criti-
cise freely all speeches and -Essays of Gentlemen of the Club. ln
speeches he shall take notice of all errors in gesture, look, language
and attitudes and in Essays all grammatical and rhetorical defects.”
"l\/lembers guilty of using profane language or intoxicating drinks
shall be expelled from our Society."
The minutes of the meetings for the next four years are a vivid
record of the intellectual life of the young seminary. The first sub-
ject for debate was “Resolved that the discovery of gold in California
has been beneficial to the United States.” Twice in the first year
there was debating on whether the United States had reached the
zenith of her glory, twice decided in the affirmative. The question
of the greatest ill in life was decided once in favor of ignorance, an-
other time in favor of disobedience. After deciding in open debate
that moral questions should be discussed in literary societies, much
time was given to debating such propositions as “Whatever is, is
1'ight”; “l\/lan is by nature good”; “Religion operates on the human
mind in subordination and not in contradiction to its natural consti-
tution”; “Conscience is an innate principle”; and “Man’s misery is
the result of his own actions.” The following debate topics suggest
the range of interest in extra-curricular matters: Resolved that planets
are inhabited by intelligent beings, that -the admission of Texas into
the Union has been a curse to the United States, that phrenology is
a true science, that Lawyers and Physicians are both nuisances to so-
ciety, that poetical taste diminishes as Education increases, that the
use of animal foods is injurious to the human system and that wealth
is unfavorable to the development of talent. It is interesting to note
