OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 11-1
The Fitrsl Addition on the Brick Schoolhouse
So inadequate was the schoolhouse by the 1890’s that at election
time in 1891 the board submitted to the voters the question of a new
public school or an addition on the - present building- at a
cost of $5000. The question 'for the $5000 improvement
carried. In July the contract for a two-room addition was given to
M`r.__Gauby of Lisbon. Two rooms Were to be added to the north-
west side of the building, one on the first floor, the other on the sec-
ond. By September the paper commented: “The high square tower
looms well above the tree tops and adds much to the appearance of
the building and the city.” The work was completed in the late fall.
Like other nineteenth century youth in America, Mount Ver-
non boys and girls were kept under rigid' discipline while in school.
Mrs. l\/Iinott says that whippings were very common in the 1S70’s.
In 1890 Principal E. T. Devine reported to the board eighteen cases
of corporal punishment in one semester about evenly distributed in
all departments. He estimated that an average of about four cases
per month was to be expected in a school of this size.
An important organization was formed on June 6, 1890. The
Hawkeye records_: “Thirty-five of Mount Vernon’s best young people
assembled in the parlors of the Misses Fancher after the graduation
exercises and organized an alumni association. Ethelda Burge ’82
was elected president; W. C. Alden 'SS secretary, and Carrie Keyes
‘SS treasurer." _
Literary societies made their appearance in the school. Debates
were a continual source of interest. The one on theneed for electric-
ity in l\-lount Vernon was especially heated.
Athletic contests had become a part of_ the schedule. There
Were football and baseball games, and there was a field day also.
Graduation was a gala occasion in the ’90’s. T he boys always
wore their conventional suits, but the girls had the opportunity to dis-
play their individuality in color and in style. A silk dress was the
height of fashion ;- full skirts almost touched the floor; high patent
leather shoes were the rage; every girl wore a corsage and flutteredla
fan. _
Graduation exercises were held in the church, and members' of
the class were seated on the platform. Their friends brought flowers
and gifts and presented them at the platform to the graduates. Each
member of the class contributed his oration as a part of the program.
The church was always packed for high school commencement.
A listof some of the well-known teachers of this period brings
back memories to' many people: Miss Ethelda Burge, Mrs. Sherwood,
l\/[iss Amanda Whittington, _Miss Rose, ldaker, Miss Hester Lytle,
