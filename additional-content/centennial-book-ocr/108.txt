98 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
a deterrent to late hours. It was not until about 1911 that all-night
service was started.
A typhoid epidemic spurred up the installation of a town Water
plant, but at the turn of the century many were still forced, even in
the winter’s cold, to bundle up and bring in water from a well. Lucky
they were if the pump didn’t have to be primed, or if it were not froz-
en. On account of the lack of a sewerage system, which made cess-
pools necessary, many hesitated to put bathrooms and kitchen sinks in
their homes. Sewerage was agitated for several years. As late as
1909 Captain C. W. Kepler was fighting the improvement, arguing
that it would bankrupt the town. Consequently this was delayed
for four or five years. '
Another difficulty the town encountered was in locating the
water mains in case of trouble. Their location was not Well planned,
and for some years the only reliable, easily accessible map was in the
head of the water commissioner, T. I. Mitchell.
Mount Vernon has always vied to keep apace if not ahead of its
friendly neighbor Lisbon, but the latter beat us to the ownership of
the first automobile. About 1901, W. S. F urnas bought a 'red Reo,
which he proudly displayed to Mount Vernon folk. Its noise like
that of a threshing machine made every one rush to the window to
behold the new invention. VVhat wonder that Mayor Elwood Macy

the weather and the season for, macadam was not yet in _use for hard
surfacing. So for work or play Old Dobbin was much in demand.
Emmett Crowell_ with his rubber-tired buggy and driving horse were
gone, but Clair Miller with his high vehicle had come to the Cornell
Campus. A ride to the Palisades or elsewhere in a livery rig was still
the height of enjoyment. If a picnic of any size was planned, then
of course it had to be the carryall drawn by two horses.
The first auto in Mount Vernon, bought by J. S. Buser in 1906
would have been coveted by James Melton. lt was a one-cylinder
Holesman, purchased in Detroit, Michigan. With the exception of
a fender in place of a step it resembled a top buggy. The large wheels
had solid rubber tires. The windshield was lacking on the car, and
its lights resembled kerosene lanterns, not only in appearance, but in
necessity of having to be lighted with a match. The numerous parts
were crated and shipped to Mount Vernon by freight. David Safley,
later a Ford dealer in Houston, Texas, who has just returned to
Mount Vernon, was at that time a popular mechanic in town and
was engaged to assemble the automobile, a job he did successfully,
according to Mrs. Buser. This car was a rare sight and lucky were
