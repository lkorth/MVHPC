THE GAY N INETIES S5
the family album. For the worldly few who chose to pay “real” cards,
progressive cinch was the game in vogue. Mrs. Barrett, who has
lived for sixty-five years in the same house to which she came as a
bride, remembers many evening parties for men and women at which
the only form of entertainment was “visitation”; and practically the
only refreshments ever served Were coffee, cake, and sliced peaches
topped with cocoanut. _ _ _ _ _
. -We read in the Hawkeye of 1893 under the l1eading_.“Parlor
Matches” that “most matches arernade in the ‘parlor in winter. In
the summer they are made on the college campus, 1over’s lane, the pine
grove and elsewhere.” “Elsewhere” might very-_well refer to some
of the benefit suppers which were patronized by the whole town, such
as the baked bean sociables put on by the G.A.R., where an ample
meal and evening's entertainment were provided for a quarter. Ice-
cream sociables in the summer, basket-suppers and oyster-suppers in
the winter furnished fun for old and young. There were many gay
dinner partie_s .at Wilcox Hall- and 'at Mrs. Fliekinger’s boarding
house; and fine food to be had at Guild Hotel. Theiregister of the
Guild Hotel reveals names of well-known people, among them Lillian
Russell, who visited her sister, Hattie Leonard of Clinton, teacher of
piano at the Cornell Conservatory. _ _
The Ladies’ Aid .of the ll/Iethodist Church, under the leadership
of l\Z[rs. A. Collin, did the catering for many large parties in the
church. Most ambitious of these money-making ventures was the
carnival held in the college chapel on October 6th and 7th of 1896
under the direction of ll/Irs. Sherwood, with the financial backing of
the business men of the town. _ _
“Hold High Carnival!
73 charming young ladies in Emblem of the City’s Industries

The Hawkeye reports that “everybody was delighted with the
pretty picture and charming appearance made by the young ladies,"
and that “the interest of the audience never lagged a minute during
the nearly three hours required.” “Opened with presentation of the
Queen, the majesty of this august personage being charmingly sustain-
ed by lVIiss hlary Collin, who from the throne summoned the fairies.
The representation proper was divided into four divisions, each one
first giving in body a fancy drill and march, followed by individual
presentation.   _ The wedding scene presented by l\'Iaster Fred Ben-
esh as rector, Della Carson and William Knox as bride and groom,
supported by Hazel `l\/loses as maid and Glen Herrick as best man,
brought down the house. The candle drill given by twelve sweet
little sleepy-heads dressed in white'“lVIother I-Iubbards” and night
caps, carrying their dolls and candles, was alone Worth more than
the price of admission. 'The little girls who took part were: l\/Iay
