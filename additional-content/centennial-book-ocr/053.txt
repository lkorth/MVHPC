FAMILY LETTERS 49
_ I have just made a nice kettle of soft soap. We still have plenty
to use until thisages. I have about the same laundry equipment as
we had at home; a barrel and pounder, tubs and a boiler. The wash-
ings are always large and I wash for the hired man. In the winter
I turned my hornespun linen sheets as they were beginning to wear
thin and I don’t like factory ones. One of my neighbors taught me
how to knit those shaggy mittens. I made Benjamin a pair for Sun-
day out- of the white yarn, with pink roses and green leaves on the
back. _ _   _-
We have looked forward to the coming of the railroad. It has
been such a long time getting to Mt. Vernon and when the day final-
ly came crowds' of people were here__for-the event. Ann Alida was
attending a tea given by her Sunday School teacher, and from angup-
per floor window _at the Seminary they-watched 'the first train 'pull
in. Now I- know that you and Father will be 'sure to come and visit
us. Benjamin thinks that you can come so easily now and you have
plenty of help to leave at home. ` ' _ ` i
Since I"last‘wrote you, We have sold our prairie farm and bought
and moved to Linn County. We have_a very nice well"built frame
house, with a cellar under the entire house.; It is situated eight miles
north of _Mt. Vernon. There is a large kitchen with a bedroom and
buttery off it, two front .rooms with a hall betweeniand two rooms
upstairs. It is painted white inside and out; two rooms are papered,
though I shall do more papering soon. There is a fine new barn with
a side hill basement under the whole building. A little brook runs
near it; there are .thiekets of wild fruit near the house. There is
plenty of timber-_and we are well sheltered. Benjamin says it is a fine
stock farm. We wanted to make maple sugar but were too busy. Ben-
jamin has sown his Wheat and oats and is plowing for corn. '
- We, too, hear a lot of war talk, but hope it never' comes. It
doesn’t seem possible _that there cannot be a peaceful _settlement other
than brother fighting against brother.
Now thatit has started, the excitement is growing less. The men
are gone and the Women and children- are left to cope with the sit-
uation alone. Maybe it doesn’t sound patriotic, but I was glad that
Benjamin wasn’t accepted. Food is scarce as the soldiers must _be
clothed and fed. The Women work in the fields doing the men's work,
Ann Alida and I with them. We hardly see real coffee, but make it
of parched barley. No sweetening but honey and molasses; there is
very little flour and we live principally on corn bread and mush., God
grant that it will soon be over. n _
It is a beautiful day and so many birds are singing I can hardly
stay in the house. Have been busy making garden and trying to clean
