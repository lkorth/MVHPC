Forms and Farming
The Centennial record of rural life around Mount Vernon pre-
sents a rich heritage of inspiration and experience. With the fi.rst
settlers rural life, much more than town life, was important. Who
can measure the final influence of 'those broad prairies? Their en-
vironment produced men of freedom and initiative, women of hos-
pitality and sturdy character. The town had its foundation of bene-
fits and riches from the farms encircling it." The history of the coun-
try is an epic of wholesome living, momentous advancement, and her-
oic endeavors. At the same time it furnishes a cross-section of one
hundred years of nation-wide rural life.
In' those yesterdays the' beautiful country-side attracted the set-
tlers with its numerous clear springs and streams; the plum and nut
trees; the bounties of- the- maple-tree;'the delicious wild berries; the
timber which furnished wood for cabins, fires and fences. The days

electric lights and power machinery. In the fields are improved vari-
eties of corn and oats and pure-bred livestock-all brought to pass
by these industrious tillers of the soil-

of the first white men to settle in Linn County, staked out his claim
in 1837. Daniel Hahn came southeast oftown in 1838. His son
John quarried the rock used in building Cornell Chapel. His grand-
son Frank, now mayor of Cedar Rapids, inherited in his grandfathefs
will the old hunting rifle and- bullet mould which grace the fireplace
in the present Cedar _Rapids home. '
Oliver Clark came in 134-O," and was in turn constable, school di-
rector, and soldier in the Nlexican War. The farm-stead of his
grandson, l\/Iarley D. Clark is part of the original land entered from
the government. _fohn Stewart came in 1838, and was juctice of the
peace; It is reported that one rainy night he leaned out of his bedroom
window and _shouted to a couple below: “Under this window in rainy
weather, I join you man and wife together.” '
Andrew J. McKean arrived in 1838 and was told that there were
no vacant lands. When he- made it plain' that he was a settler and
