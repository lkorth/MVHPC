Chapter 16
Fair Old Cornell
The year 1908 marked the end of the memorable administration
of President King and the beginning of that of President Harlan. It
did not, however, mark the turning point in the history of Cornell
as President Harlan continued to carry out the same policies that he
had worked out as vice-president under King for more than two dec-
ades. He was the first of the three Cornell alumni to be elevated to
the Presidency+Harlan, Updegraff and Cole, beginning in November
1943. This chapter covering the administrations of Presidents Har-
lan 1908-1914, Flint 1915-'22, Updegraff 1922-’27, Burgstahler ’Z7-
’39, Magee ’39-’43 and Cole attempts to trace the history of the col-
lege through forty years of change in education.
Dr. James E. Harlan, a graduate of the class of ’69, began his
career at Cornell as alumni professor of mathematics in 1873, to which
astronomy was added in 1880 and the usual “President’s subjects”-
Mental and Nloral -Philosophy, Ethics and Evidences of Christianity
-were added' in the eighties and nineties. Dr. Williann Ebersole
summarizes his services to the college in the following tribute:
“He was a. m-an of quietdignity, highly conscientious, firm
but just, of a judicial type of mind _ _ . For decades he was prac-
tically sole director of internal administration, doing most of the
work himself, including finance, discipline ,etc. His adminis~
tration was safe, economical and successful, during which there
were two successful financial campaigns in which he had a prom-
inent part. These were the Twentieth Century campaign for
$400,000 (1892-1902) and the $500,000 campaign completed
»-=in@ 1909 and a number of other financial and building acquisi-
tions in which he was a promoter.”
i Seldom has a man given himself to his college with more Whole-
souled devotion than did Corne1l’s President Harlan.
Associated with him in the early years of the century was a splen-
did staff, comparable to the grand old men of the King regime-Cob
lin, Boyd, Williams, Freer and Norton. Of these Dr. Norton was
to 'have many more yearsof usefulness and Dr. Freer to give dis-
tinguished service as dean of the college from 1902 to 1919 and in-
valuable aid on financial campaigns and as speaker to alumni groups
far and wide. They, together with Professors Ebersole, Kelly,
Knight, Stanclift and Keyes and the Ristines helped to keep the
college on even keel during this and later changes in administration.
