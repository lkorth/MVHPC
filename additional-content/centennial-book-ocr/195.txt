FAIR OLD CORNELL 175
The educational pattern at Cornell has been, and is, an evolving
process. Its Curriculum committee has always been 'the most .active
of the facultycommittees. Continuously_it has sought to study and
re-evaluate its aims in the "light ofcurrent demands and needs, and to
reappraise -methods whereby these aims may 'be approximated.
Through the years .much experimentation has been done. _As is
atrue-=of most colleges-of fits age, requirements -gave way in _part to a
period -of ~.quite- “free-'elec1iion,” .only _to *be followed -by increasing =re-
quirements,'-madeneeessarysbylthe vastextent of=our intellectual and
social -heritage, and -the .selectivity needed to -insure 'a common Pbasis
of Qknowledget The fpresent field .requirements .in six “great 'areas
of culture”-the 'Fine.Arts, -the Social ?Sciences, the Natural Sciences,
fLanguage.and .Liter-ature, Philosophy and Religion, and Health .and
fldhysical "Education-ihave gproved an 'effective .means of extending
lmomiledge, skill, 'and '3HPr€Ciation. _ Q i _
° The .vocational interest has always been regarded as legitimate,
but- never- "in-'the narrow senseof technical `trainin'g only. ` ' -Pre-profes~
sional training at Cornell' College haszbeen*-acclaimed byfmany univer-
sities to "which 'its studentsfhave.gone,- and _the 'Liberal Artsemphasis,
and ‘breadth lofgbackground, 'have contributed not-only .to vocational
competence in teaching,-and other fields, 'but have enabled fthe' in-
dividual"ton1ake_ a .richer contribution to home andfcommunity.

_its .most lhighlyitrained and experienced personnel have served _iE`resh~
man students as freely as those of upper-’!:lass~standing. _ _ _ -
