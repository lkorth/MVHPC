lt-lount Vernon has always' been noted for offering' the very best
talent forits lectures and concerts. Booker T. Washington came
in 1900, and' in 1903 Captain Richmond P. Hobson gave a lecture
on “The Nation and lts Navy.” He presented a very tall and dig-
nified appearance on the platform, and in so far as is known, he
kissed no babies in Mount Vernon. `
Old time-revival meetings were also held 'bringing to town
Shawhan, Billy Sunday and the singers Elderkin and Tibbett (not
Lawrence). - `
We have left to the last Mount Vernon’s popular entertai-nment,
the movies. At the beginning of the century every cityand town of
any size boasted of its -nickelodeon, 5c admsision on week days, 10c
on Sundays. To keep the public coming, serials running from twenty
to forty weeks were shown. The first movie house in town, the Del-
phus, was in the building, now a tavern, on the north side of Main
Street, corner of lwlain and First Avenue. It was operated by Ar-
thur W; Broadmeadow, husband of Marie Doron. The next theatre
run by Frank Beach and later by l\/Ir. Hendryx was diagonally across
the-street in the former Platner building.
By 1912 feature length films were shown. In 1921 Lawrence
West had 'taken over and was operating a theatre on the present lo-
cation and one at Lisbon, the latter for a short time only. The name
Liberty was later changed to Strand. By 1930 or '31 Mount Vernon
had sound films. These at first were not regular talking pictures,
but the old Vitaphone with music played from a _disc synchronized
with the action on the screen. _lust what happened when the timing
was not accurate, and the characters moved their lips with no sound
coming forth, you all can guess. Soon the regular talking picture
was perfected, and Mount Vernon can now boast as good a little
theater as can be found in any town of this size, with upholstered,
comfortable seats, air conditioning, etc. _   g- y
