144 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
Was provided. In the evening an impromptu dramatic skit in Ash
Park furnished much amusement. A number of the college faculty
took part, but none provided the merriment that Dr. Nicholas Knight
did in the role of a ballet dancer. A huge bonfire lighted up the
grounds and legend has it that the Kaiser was burned in effigy.
Dancing took place on the pavement in the business section of the town
under the direction of Prof. Clyde Tull, known on the campus as
“Toppy.” Taps sounded for the S.A.T.C. boys at nine as the dancing
continued. Mount Vernon had experienced the greatest celebration
of her history.
