THE EARLY CHURCHES 39
changed the name of their church to the First Presbyterian Church
of Mount Vernon, and three years later erected a brick building 40
by 50 feet. There was too much hope in their enterprise, and the
building was never used as a church, but was sold for a shop and later
became an apartment house. This branch merged with the Old
School in 1870 under John Stewart as one of the elders.
_ The _Covenanters organized in 1847 at Sugar Grove two miles
west of town. The following fourteen persons were at first received
as members: Jeremiah and Nancy Smyth, Robert and Nancy Smyth
Alexander, James and Elizabeth Smyth, George and Jennett Safely,
Martha Craig, Margaret Corey, Robert Smyth, Elizabeth Boyd and
Catherine and Susan Smyth. Jeremiah and Robert Smyth were the
elders. For' twenty years this' group existed as a corporation but fin-
ally disbanded in 1874, uniting with the Olde School. The Smyth
family came from Ireland in 1842. Robert Smyth was an executive
member and a trustee of Cornell College and also a member of the
Iowa legislature. _
The Old School began in a log school house near the .lohn Kirk-
patrick farm three miles north of town. A church was organized in
Lisbon in 1854, but was united with the Old School in Mount Ver-
non in 1861 with a total of thirty-two members in the congregation.
The Reverend Edward Dodcler was the pastor here and at Linn
Grove for seven years beginning in March 1861. The church pros~
pered under his ministry so that 'Mount Vernon was made a separate
station. The congregation used the Reformed Church building
which stood just east of the present high school.
In 1863, the hall over the present Dale Johnson hardware store
was rented and used for services for three years. The church was
prospering and a new building was planned and erected. It was a
wooden structure of the board and batten type and was painted
brown. The entrance was on the north and the pulpit was at the
southern end. When the new church was built, the old church was
remodelled -into a double residence which stands on the original site
diagonally across the street from the high school. Services were first
held here June 5, 1866. The cost of the lot was $200 and the build-
ing was $2,8`00. All is said to have been paid for at the time of dedi~
cation.
The Reverend E. B. Farrar came in 1868 and remained one
year. He was followed for two years by the Reverend George Lodge,
under whom in an extensive revival sixty additional members were
received. After the separation of thirty years the Old and the New
School Assemblies united, and James Hanna was called to be pastor
in 1873. The following year the Covenanters disbanded and joined
the united groups. A new parsonage was erected and the church grew
in membership, self-support, and missionary giving. While President
