THE GAY NINETIES 37
light, returning to escort the young man to a small room where he
slept soundly. Not until the next morning did the embarrassed couple
realize that they had spent the night in the same room which the
ingenious hostess had hastily divided with a curtain. Mr. _Harry
Bassett, the man in the case, vouches for the truth of the story.
Major sports of the nineties were baseball, croquet and lawn ten-
nis in the summer; coasting and skating in the winter; and hiking and
picniclcing at the-Pal whenever the weather was suitable. Collecting
of bird’s eggs and Indian relics was often a part of these outings. The
second meeting-of the Iowa Ornithological Association met here in
1896; fifty years later in l94-6 it met here again, which indicates
that scientific interest in birds has lasted throughout the years. This
boyhood interest in birds and Indian relics has caused Charles R.
Keyes to be elected president of the Iowa Ornithological Association
and Director of the Archeological Survey of the State Historical So-
ciety of Iowa.
Nlount Vernon boys delighted in baseball and tennis during all
the decade. Although Cornell had entered upon its mighty football
rivalry with Coe, Grinnell and other college teams, town b oys did
not take up the sport until later. Tennis courts on the campus and a

"town," down the hill from the Methodist church, on the long street
beginning east of the campus and ending near the stone quarry, and

by oyster stew were. a part_of winter’s fun. _ Typical of such good
times was the New Year’s eve party in 1897. `
“A happy New Year-’s .Eve was engaged in by a _party of young
people who were taken by bobsled to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Geig-
er just west of town. The home being gracefully turned over to them
with all the privileges of the place, they held high carnival as the
old year went out.. Crolcinole, parchesi and carom boards furnished
amusement. A good supply of oysters, served hot- with Geiger’s ex-
cellent Jersey milk, did the rest.” _
Nothing in the period of the nineties is farther from modern
taste thanytheir _art. Young ladies burdened their houses with dec-
orated lambrequins, flowers painted on velvet squares, scenic fire-
shovels, burnt leather pillowtops, hand-painted pin cushions, and other
art objects too numerous to mention. lVIiss Blanche Lee came down
regularly from Mechanicsville to teach a class in tapestry painting.
It was the era of the wooden Indian in front of the cigar store, of
the picket fence, of star and crescent shaped flower beds, of the base
burner, and the center table, and the folding bed which had the inno-
