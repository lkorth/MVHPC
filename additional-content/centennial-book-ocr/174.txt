154- HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
On account of poor health, the Reverend Knox terminated his
pastorate and preached his final sermon on Oct. 28, 1906, “Having
done all to stand” was his text. He preached with great difficulty.
He died at two o’clock the next morning, faithful unto death. Read-
ing some of his sermons at this date, we are impressed with the earnest-
ness and wide variety of interest in history, literature, and everyday
life. e
The Reverend Ioseph W. Hubbard was pastor at Linn Grove
from 1896 to 1899 when he moved to town and bought the old church
building and remodeled it into an apartment building. As chairman
of the Historical Committee of the Synod, he wrote a valuable “His-
tory of the Presbyterian Church in Iowa, 1337-1900.” He had been
in early days a tutor of Grover Cleveland and retained his friendship
through the years.
The Reverend A. R. Bickenbach, a forceful and witty speaker,
was pastor from 1907 to 1910. The bell was placed in the tower
at this time. He was much in demand as an after-dinner speaker.
The Reverend Oliver Thompson preached for one year, and then
there came in June l9l2, the Reverend Charles Nl. Robb, who re-
mained for nine years, and filled the church to capacity. He also or-
ganized a brotherhood of 130 members, which held father-and-son
banquets for many years. At the Centennial, he sent greetings from
Wichita, Kansas. The Reverend C. F. Stratton remained for six
years as pastor from 1922 to 1928. He built up many lasting friend-
ships. The Reverend W. B. Ray filled in for one year. The econ-
omic depression at this time made former salaries difficult to raise, so
a succession of young men was called. The Reverend Roland D.
Snuffer served from 1930 to 1932: the Reverend Everett C. lV[oore-
head, did excellent work with young people and went 'on to the large
Westwood Church in Cincinnati. From there he sent Centennial
greetings: “Remembers Jesus is Pilot. A ship never sinks until water
gets on the inside. _Don’t get water-logged. Keep buoyant and you
will reach the eternal harbor.” The Reverend joseph W. Gray was
pastor from 1937 to 1942, when he accepted a call to Huron, South
Dakota. In a letter read at the Centennial, he recalled the sun
reflected from the ice at the top of the tall steeple, a symbol of the
Church reflecting the light of God as it points the way to Heaven.
The Reverend Lewis McKibben, an experienced teacher in college
and pastorate, came from 1942 to 1945. He organized an inspiring
Centennial program which was given on Sunday, October 24, 1943.
Dr. H. C. Stanclift reviewed his noteworthy work on the hundred
years of Presbyterianism in our city which was later published as a
valuable book. He was for years a clerk of sessions and a prominent
leader in the church. Many speakers of note took part in the all-day
celebration, an enjoyable and note-worthy event. The outward his-
