iuz HISTORY _os MOUNT 'VERNON
At -the turn of -the,centu_ry -the “Hawkeye” ci-ted 'Mount Vernon’s
needs as follows: 1.`A new depot. 2. A first class crearnery. 3. .A
chicken buyer and shipper. 4. An_oil tankline plant. 5. _A .new hotel.
'Pressure was 'brought gto bear on the Chicagoand Northwestern Rail-
way officials, and our depot became a .reality and was formallyopened
January 1, 1902. lt was fortunate --that'-ticket -sales between here and
Cedar Rapids were very considerable 'at that -time and Mount Ver-
non’s 'importance to -the road _could be argued. '
°` The creainery came and was operated 'by   F _ -Beyer of Edge-
wood, but _was later moved to Cedar'-Rapids. 1In,the spring of 1928,
el\/Iount -Vernon 'acquired _a poultry and :produce _plant,0,ef~ficient_1y op-
erated at _the present 'time -by F.   Peterson,  
A mass meeting of citizens in 1902 decided -that-a new Ehotel was
a _most -compelling need. Traffic along the Lincoln Highway -was in~
creasing, and it was felt that Mount Vernon shou-ldfbid forpatron-
age _of the traveling public. A stock company was at once organized;
shares selling _at $100 each. The officers were: "President, H. H.
Rood; Vice-President, W. E. Platner; Secretary, J. D1 Harrington;
-Treasurer, D. L. Boyd. Thendirectors were C. W. Kepler, Cl_em
Falcon and 'I-I.   Freer. ` $5500 _was pai_d_ for three lot_s belonging to
H. G. Miller and G. W. Young. T `
" The _building plans 'called' for a structure ofthree stories with
basement, made of pressed brick with -stone trimming. '
In November -18, 1903, it was _opened to the public, the-efirstrnan
to register being HL N. Smith -of‘eNew York- City. Amos Scott,
whom many willremember, wasthe first day -porter, and Rosie Hart-
man, now°Mrs. A. G. Walton," was la waitress. The first manager
was W. D. Millar. ‘ ' R 1 -
\ ' Theename "Altoona," chosen in a contest was suggested by -the
town Altoona, Pennsylvania,”-at the 'base ofthe-Alleghany Mountains,
so called because' of its altitude and sightly location.
" mln 1904 owing to the debt which was -found difficult to dis-
charge, the entire establishment was sold to'William F. King, presi-
dent of Cornell, who undertook -to run the place for the good-of town
andfcollege. E. R.-'Ristine was manager for twoeand a half years,
andi business was considered good. _ - » ,
  The advent of the interu-rban and the increase in autos made
transportation to Cedar Rapids too easily available, however, so with
the coming- of World War' I, the hotel was made into- army barracks,
occupied' by a-unit of--the S.A.T.C., and after that into a college dormi-
tory. When the Altoona became college property, Mrs. Laura Al-
beck Hoffman opened her home to transients. This is the parental
Albeclc home across from the high school building. Mrs. Hoffman
called this the Mount Vernon. Hotel and operated it efficiently for
thirty years. In the spring of 1947 it_was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Roy
Winchip, farmers north of town, who will -continue as hotel operators.
