promptly knocked down by another Federal soldier, then run off the
college grounds. In his “Reminiscences” Dr. King added, “The year
closed the most remarkable and saddest commencement of which I
have any knowledge.” Added sorrow came to the school and com-

Reverend Rufus Parsons,a student of the time, is authority for
still another story illustrating the tenseness of the period. 1On "the
evening before the 1863 commencement day, great excitement ran
through the town ‘over thereport that Copperheads were heard at the
Stone Quarry. Upon' investigation the enemy proved to- be college
boys practicing orations for the next day.
As the war continued and more men were called, those at home
waited anxiously for news from the front. The nearest telegraph line
