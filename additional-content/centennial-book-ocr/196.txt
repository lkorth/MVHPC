1 World War- II If
World War II came upon Mount 'Vernon as it did upon the
country. Through the late Thirties feeling had swung between a
high of hope that the conflict'cou1d`be avoided and alow of certainty
that its coming was inevitable. Editorials and radio eloquence urging
defense were accepted -and_ forgotten, but each issue of the local paper
carried an advertisement urging young- men to enlisttin the navy. In
August 1941 the much criticized Rugg textbooks: that were thought
to undermine Americanism were replaced in the Mount Vernon
schools and in November the local school board “was considering a
course in -defense in, the high school.” A new flag pole was dedi-
cated on the Cornell campus that same fall and a sober-faced group
of young men- watched the flag flutter to the top of it. ` 1
_°   bombing _of Pearl Harbor stirred the country' to action and
Mount Vernon stirred, too. The I-Iawlceye-Record of the following
iweek contained an quarter column 'list of persons 'and homes whose
thoughts flew to some one in the danger areaand the issue for January
15 contained an eye Witness account of the bombing.” Cornell stu-
dents were advised by Dean _]`. B. MacGregor to sit tight and await
the orderly procedures of induction' into service. ` ‘ I
.Carl Travis 'was named head of_ the committee for civilian de-
fense; courses in first aid were planned. and a class of 36 ‘completed
the course under the instruction of Carroll Luckey, a senior biology
student in Cornell. Red Cross plans for sewing and knitting emerg-
ed at once and remained active forms of 'service for the duration of
the War. - _ , °
Food became a matter of concern with sugar the first commodity
to be affected. On January 15, 1942 sales were li-mited to five
pounds per person “if the dealer had it to sell" which precipitated a
hoarding rush. In April it Was rationed with extrastamps issued
in May for canning purposes. Gasoline was rationed in November
1942 and fuel oil in the following December. These restrictions
became subjects of conversation wherever two or more were gath-
ered together. On ]anuary'7; 1943 the schools were closed and on
that day the teaching staff 'under Superintendent Ostergaard as-
sisted by women of the town registered for general rationing books
the 1,389 applicants who appeared at the high school building. There-
after the housewife budgeted her points and the merchants counted
stamps. '
