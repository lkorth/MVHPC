Early Development in the Incorporated Town
_ The 1860's saw the end of the pioneer era and ushered in a boom
period common to the settlements that were becoming of age along
America'S Western frontier." ` ' ' -
Mount Vernon hailedthe arrival of "the Chicago and North
Western Railway in 1859, as did Cedar Rapids a year later. The
trains rolling infrom Chicago brought new settlers, new ideas, and
products. In the next few years they were to take back corn, wheat,
horses, and men for a nation engaged in Civil War. _
` Veterans returning from the war in 1865 gave impetus to the
mushrooming growth of the young village. They brought back with

We .are perfectly safe in saying' thathe was singing because “Billie”
always sang after a drink. Seated in his high spring wagon -he let his
horse “Nigger” wander down the railroad track instead of the road.
A west bound freight came along. When the locomotive stopped for
Water at Lisbon, trainmen discovered “Billie” on his wagon seat on
the cowcatcher unhurt. “Nigger” was found grazing alongthe rail-

At this time the Camp brothers opened a-carriage and wagon
