mission to go out straw-berrying with the girls. The Gentle-
men then adjourned to the grove. Mather climbed a tree and
all climbed upon stumps; no motions were made but one by Mr.
Dimmitt which consisted in his attempting to jump and fell down.
After tea the Gentlemen of the Clubb proceeded to select corn-
panions for berrying. The Duum viri obtained two and ran
away from the others who went in whatsoever direction their
desires led them. All desires seemed ultimately to tend toward
the ice Cream Saloon,` which is kept by an Anti-Slavery gentle-
man. Post plenam ventrem habebant, they gallanted their ladies
home full of hope and glory.

So it can be seen that from the beginning Literary Societies p1ay~
ed a vital part in the intellectual and social life of the college. Their
“publics" Were gala events attended by townspeople as well as students
over a long period of years. By action of the Board of Trustees in
1871 it was decided that Cornell was not to be a fraternity school.
A chapter of Phi Kappa Psi founded in 1868 was dissolved as a re-
sult of this decision.
In 1862 -the death of the Greek professor necessitated the find-

birthday was_ teaching the Classics in Ohio Wesleyan University.
President Fellows had heard of him and upon inquiry he was assured

favor of accepting the offer from Mount Vernon.
_ Dr. King in writing of this decision afterwards in his book
“Reminiscences” says "While the pararnount duty to sustain the gov-

could not be ignored; so the decision was made to go to Cornell, at

Fellows had written: "I think you would find it a pleasant and use~
ful field of labor. There is a fine opportunity here to build up a
reputation and to aid in building up a college.” On August 28,

finds friends and excuses for hard work. People already on the
scene, such as Alonzo Collin, son of the Squire, Susan Hale, I-Iarriette
Cooke, the inimitable woman professor, helped King to become es-
tablished and fired him with their. own enthusiasm. _ g
