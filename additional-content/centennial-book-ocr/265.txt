[Little Mt. Vernon, acity today
of perhaps 1,400 persons, has -given
an incredible contingent of leader-'

picture executives, writers of pop-»
ular songs, scientists, surgeons,
journalists, the founders! a na-
tional lecture bureau, novelists,
war correspondents and Methodist
bishops. All of these hailed from
Mt. Vernon‘s hilltop.
°`With the rest of America, Mt.
Vernon has lived through four
wars. (Though the Mexican war
did not come to an end until one
year after the :lounding of the
Iowa-town, apparently Mt. Vernon
was untouched' by it.) `
_ One hundred' sixteen men went
~rn_Mt._Vernon tolhe Battle of
Shiloh in Company A of the 13th
Iowa regiment. (The little town
also contributed heavily to three
other companies in the northern
armies. In 1862-63 only 11 men
remained in the four college
classes at ` Cornell, and two of
them were cripples.) Twenty-sew
en survivors were mustered out of
Company A July 21, 1865, the rest
had died in the war.
One 'of Mt. Vernonfs many
Civil War heroes was Capt.
(later lieutenant colonel) Justin
C. Kennedy who had been the
Northwestern station agent at -
Mt. Vernon. With two staff of-
ficers and 18 men he dashed
into the city of Columbia, S. C.,
“where secession was born,"
and hung out the fiag of his
'regiment from the capitol build~
ing.
Three men from Mt. Vernon en-_
listed Dec. 15, 1862, in the 37th
Iowa, the famous “graybeard regi-»
rnnt”, whose soldiers were all
over 45, some as old as 60. At the
fourth annual reunion of Linn
county Civil war veterans in Mt.
Vernon, Aug. 29 and 30, 1888,
Richard J, Harbert, a Mt. Ver-
nonite and a former soldier, was

"Were the Gay Ntnetles really
gay?" The history raises this ques-
tion. Since the Methodists and the
Presbyterians were dominating
religious groups in the town from
the beginning--they are still the
only '~-two old-line Protestant
churches in. town--liquor was
frowned upon. There was very lit-
tle dancing. `
Butthe young folk ot Mt. _Verde
non seem to have made out -a
good time, nevertheless.. There
were taffy-pulls, charades and
guessing games, _ and, for the
worldly few who delighted in
cards a game known as "‘pro-
gressive cinch". There were benef
fit socials, suppers and bazaars.
The first talking machine 'in
town was owned by Banker Smith
and his wife in '94, but the best-
remembered. machine was in
Haeseler’s drug store, where
crowds used to congregate to rnar-

Perhaps a major value of the
Mt. Vernon history is that- it
