206 HISTORY OF MOUNT 'VERNON
And, as we close the pages of “Honorable Mention,” we pay
tribute to our beloved town and all its boys and girls who are doing
their work quietly and efficiently. _
We feel that
“Every child should know a hill
And the clean joy of running
down its long slope
_ _ With the wind in his hair.”
From this hilltop community we have sent forth our sons and
daughters “through time and place to roam.” To them we have giv-
en our city’s heritage- and inspiration. From them theworld knows
ourwork, our ambitions, and our dreams. Wherever they go they
speak well for us and they return to continue proudly and success-
fully _the work of our own -Mount Vernon.
" “Our gifts once given must here abide.” _
