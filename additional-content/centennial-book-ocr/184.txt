presented three stages at different levels on which pioneers in covered
wagons, companies of soldiers, students, townspeople and historic

Independent colleges such as Cornell differ in several important
particulars from state-supported institutions. One of these differ-
ences is that funds for their support must come, not from taxes, but
from gifts from individuals and corporations. Cornell has shared in
reasonable degree in these various forms of benevolence. From the
General_Education Board- some $700,000 has been received during
the years, and from the Carnegie Corporation, $75,000.
In the matter of gifts from individuals, while the larger gifts
come more immediately to mind, many smaller gifts have been note-
worthy in the college’s history as an expression of the interest and
loyalty of the donors. Many of these have come from residents of
Mount Vernon, from local clubs and the $5,000 subscription made by
the Ladies Aid Society of the Methodist Church.
The largest gift made to the college 'at its- time was that for
$100,000 given by ‘William F. ]ohnston,._chai1'rnan of the Board of
Trustees from 1884 to 1914. This was supplemented later by a
bequest of $75,000 from his daughter, ll/Iiss Anna B. Johnston. Presi-
dent King gave $100,000 to furnish scholarships for each of the
ninety-nine Iowa counties and an additional one for the larger Kossuth
County. _
Affecting the entire program of the Fine Arts Division. was the
bequest of Mrs. Blanche Swingley Armstrong, ’91, which made pos-
sible the building of theArmstrong Hall of Fine Arts, with a fund
of $53,325 for its maintenance. The gift of the Law building by llflar-
ion Law has already been noted. `
Of first importance in the recent history of Cornell have been
the gifts and interest of Henry and Annie Merner Pfeiffer whose
