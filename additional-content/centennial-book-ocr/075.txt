Chapter, 8 V
Cornell Under William Fletcher King
The histories of Mount Vernon and of Cornell College are fine-
ly intertwined from the beginning. Occasionally there have been rifts
in the relations of the two but never has there beenthe traditional op-
position of Town and Gown. To the town of Mount Vernon the
college has always been a distinct asset, duly recognized and cherish-
ed. The same figures have been prominent in both. It is appropriate,
therefore, to include in this History of Mount Vernon a second chap-
ter of college history covering the forty-three year administration of
President King from Civil War days until 1908 and a third covering
the later development of the college from that date until the present.
An ev_ent of supreme importance to the college was the building
ofthe Chicago and Northwestern Railway through Mt. Vernon in
1859. It had been intended to cross the Mississippi River at Fulton,
Illinois, and run west through Maquolceta and Anarnosa. The high
price of land asked for the right of way caused the owners to choose
a route farther south through comparatively unsettled territory.
They erected a depot at what became- Clinton, built a bridge some
miles below Fulton and came west through farm lands clustered about
very small towns. The railroads had to make detours to enter the
larger towns like Cedar Rapids, Marshalltown and Des Moines.
The value of the railroad to Mount Vernon and Cornell College was
great as it put them on the trans-continental route from Chicago to
Omaha and thence by the famous Union Pacific to the West. `
- Other factors in the early growth of the young seminary into a
flourishing college -were its co-educational beginnings-a departure
from accepted practices in the East where segregation was the rule-,
its adoption by the Upper Iowa Conference of the Methodist Church
in 1855 when the Iowa Conference was divided, and a policy adopted
by the trustees at the very beginning which was of lasting benefit.
This was to select merrihers of the Board from far scattered regions
rather than to have a local board with a narrow patronage. The re-
sult was educational prestige indistant regions, especially in the East,
and every catalog shows a student patronage from a score or more
states. Missionary connections were early established and there were
attendants from foreign countries, especially from the Orient,
throughout the years covered in this chapter.
From the beginning of the college provision was made for Stil-
dents not of college grade. In the days of the “Iowa College Sem-
inary” there was what was designated as a “Common English” course
scheduling: reading (McGuffey’s Fifth), grammar, geography and
