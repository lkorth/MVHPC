Chapter ' 4 __ '
The Early Churches
Early settlers were scarcely established on their claims before
they received a visit from some Methodist circuit-rider. In regions
where settlers were miles apart and severed ;from_ former as-
sociations, the pioneer preacher guided thernbaclr into religious fel-
lowship and put the impress of godliness on those who came under
his influence. In 184-0 all the Territory of Iowa was one district of
the Rock River Conference of the Methodist Church. Shortly after-
ward it was dividedinto two districts, the Dubuque District under the
Reverend Bartholomew_Weed, and the,Burlington District. In the
former, work in Mount Vernon was begun August 26, 1340, when
the Marion Mission was organized with the Reverend John Hodges
as missionary. His long itinerary included Marion, Martin’s Creek,
Mount Zion, Linn Grove, Pleasant Hill, Yankee Grove (Lisbon),
Pioneer Grove, Mechanicsville, and Olin. ._
, From 1847 to 1850 the Reverend George Bowman was pre-
siding elder .of the Dubuque Distriet_. He formulated plans to com-
bine all the preaching points around Mount Vernon into one charge
on the hilltop. In 1850 of his own choice he resigned the elder-
ship to become pastor of the Linn Grove Circuit. Services in the vil-
lage were held in the school house on West Main Street. ' ` `
One day Elder Bowman was seen hauling to the site of the pres-
ent school house a load of brick from Albright's bricltyard at the foot
of the hill. "‘What are you doing, Elder?" he was asked;
“I am going to build a church,” he replied. I-Ie had quietly col-
lected money in the East for this purpose, and soon a building 40 by
50 feet, without balcony or spite, was erected and dedicated, free of
debt. The churchfhad two front doors; there were two aisles and
four sections of seats. At that time the men and women occupied sep-
arate sections. ° ,
_Conrad Kepler hauled the pine lumber for the church' from
Dubuque. He paid the $150.00 he was assessed by cradling and
threshing wheat under the feet of cattle and hauling it to Muscatine
where he sold it for thirty cents a bushel. His sacrifice was typical
of that of every pioneer Methodist."
Elder Bowman immediately began a great revival to reach the
unconverted of the town and to promote religious interest. Scores
of people were brought into the church, among them the leading men
of the community: Allison Willits, Elijah Waln, William Hayzlett,
Peter, Henry and Conrad Kepler, George Edgerton and many others.
