Chapter 'I
Pioneer Days
In Mount Vernon’s Centennial Year of 1947 the community
looks back on one hundred years of inspiring and interestinghistory.
Mount Vernon+“The Hilltop.” The mention of that name brings
fond memories to hundreds if not thousands scattered over the globe.
Sixteen miles east of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, there stands a mile long hill,
white in winter, green in spring, and flaming gold in the fall. It is
visible many miles around. From it an unending stream of influence
has gone forth to enrich the earth. The mystic touch of the Hilltop,
through its sons and daughters, has been world wide. The first 'main
road in Iowa, laid out in 1840 by a furrow ploughed between Iowa
City and Dubuque, later known as the Military Road, came over
the hill, and is now called First Avenue. The Lincoln Highway
crossing the nation from east to west, the Main Street of the nation,
runs along. the hilltop. Over it there passes in endless procession cars
fron; almost every state, trucks and buses, both local and transcontin-
611113. a
The story of that century is a heritage of experience and achieve-
ment that gives perspective. The spirit of the pioneer embodied ad-
venture, initiative and courage. In Mount Vernon it produced great
religious figures, teachers, inventors, educators, scientists, and leaders
of men, all helping to foster progressive civilization. »
The long geologic ages prepared the site of the hilltop. The Sil-
urian Age left crinoids and mollusks in the bluffs of the Palisades.
Our own geologic expert, Dr. William H. Norton, found a mastodon
tooth in Linn Grove; another was found near Abbey Creek. The Ice
Age for thousands of years shoved down sheets of clay and broken
rock to give this area the most fertile soil of anystate in the union.
Iowa is the bread-basket of the nation and of the earth, its soil draw-
ing the pioneer settlers as a magnet.
n Mount Vernon boys who explored the caves and cliffs at the
“Pal” did not suspect that for a thousand years the Indians had made
the Cedar' River a main highway' for their canoes, and had slept and
eaten in those caves. Mount Vernon’s archeological expert, Dr.
Charles R. Keyes, of nationwide reputation, identified-many of the
early specimens of Indian civilization in this vicinity. He has made a
thorough classification' of them and isnow writing extensively on this
subject. The Indians gave the river its name-Red Cedar. They
also gave us many nativeffoodv-the maize that made Iowa the Corn
State, potatocs, tomatoes, beans, pumpkins,_squash, and others. _
