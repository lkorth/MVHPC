one rnen’s clothing store, on tailor shop, one furniture store, one meat
market, one floral shop", two blacksmith shops, two shoe stores, two
barber shops, one shoe repair shop, one shop manufacturing cement
vaults, one motion picture, two newspapers, and two banks.”
No one in town can recall our earliest settlement. A small num-
ber can recollect the seventies, Among them are Mrs. ]ohn Hood-
maker, Mrs. Ely West, Mrs. David West, C. W. Carley, and C. W.
Heller. Many of us, however, can recall business and professional
people of the first quarter of the twentieth century. Mabel Shirer_
Boyd was almost indispensable in_the town. A busy mother training
four growing boys, she always dropped her work at home to sing in
public gatherings for her friends. Dr. Alexander Crawford and
his family moved to Mount Vernon in 1900, and Dr. Crawford was
very quickly in demand in community affairs. Dr. Merrill Wil-
liams' was a dentist practicing in his home town.
Among our merchants were Lewis Chapman and Watson Kep-
ler whohad a shoe store.   Kyle sold shoes also. ]ohn Merritt,
E. E. Goodhue, and ]..G. Fox all dealt in groceries. Mr. Fox fur-
nished many a laugh to the townspeople with his weekly advertise-
ments for John and Mary ending with “Nuf sed.” At this time Mr.
Hiner and Clement Falcon_h_ad succeeded Martin Rigby and A. A.
Berryman in the Citizens' 'State Bank. Henry and Leonard
Kopf ran the meat market. Before the days when Cedar Rapids
bakeries sold their bread to Mount Vernon, grocers always with-
held their last delivery for fresh rolls and bread from J. F. Bar-
rett’s bakery. George Soper and H. S..Risser had coal offices, ]ohn
Petty rented fine horses from his livery stable for buggy rides. Ed
Turner with his big brown bulldog tied on a_leash was our town
marshal and following Ed. was Bob Morford with a big black _and
white bulldog tied on a leash. Over on First Avenue, South, Charles
W. Warren hadlocated in George ]ohn’s shop and was carrying on
his 'trade as a blacksmith". Mrs. A. K. Knox and her son "Bill"
furnished many a happy occasion for both college and town groups
with the banquets they served. _
In a significant number of instances stability has been given our
town by the fact that vocations have been_ carried on from father to
son. 'The Carson family, Dr. james, and his sons, Dr. John and Dr.
George, were here for an approximate span of seventy years. A fine
harness and leather Store, advertised always as Stewart Ellison’s, was
started in 1859. In 1893 Harry Ellison joined his father and after
the death of Stewart Ellison carried on the businessundcr the name
Stewart Ellison’s ,Son until 1935. Simon H. Bauman started the
Hawkeye in 1869. In the latter part of the century his two sons, Fred
and Augustus, were associated with their father. Eventually “Gus”
Bauman became the editor and continued in that capacity until 1925.
