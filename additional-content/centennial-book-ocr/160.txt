During the harvest season of 1918 a number of Mount Vernon men
unknowingly made a contribution in the following manner. One eve-
ning D. E. Hedges, Chas. E. Hedges, F. W. Howson, H. S. Risser,
E. E. Kyle, L. E. Chapman, Dr. E. L. Glasier, E. R. Lahman, Dr. G.
H. Wandel, J. E. Coleman, Chas. M. Hartung, and   E. Beach aid-
ed Otis Ellison to shock thirty acres of oats as he had been unable to
get farm help. After the Work had been done and refreshments en-
joyed, Mr. Ellison presented the group with a check for twenty dol-
lars made out to the local Red Cross chapter. Even after the Armis-
tice contributions continued. Among them was one for $2.00 from
the children of a rural school taught by hits. Brooks. One day Anton
Novak presented a load of squash which was sold for $6.05.
Not all of the appeals were for money. One day the following
request appeared in the paper: “The local Red Cross would like
to know the name of a person who will contribute a quarter of a cord
of wood to heat the Worltroom." The spring brought the following:
‘flf convenient, set a hen for the benefit of.the local chapter. Call it
the “Red Cross I-len.” and sell the chicks for the benefit of the local
chapter. If a dozen people would contribute in this way, it would
be quite an addition to our funds.” ,
The citizens of Mount Vernon and the surrounding community
responded splendidly to each of the four Liberty Loan drives. 'When
the bonds first arrived, Clem Falcon of the Citizens’ 'State Bank an-
nounced through the press that “a detailed description is of little
avail. They must be seen to be appreciated; or better yet, owned.”
Much interest was displayed in Mount Vernon and Lisbon, and school
children had a holiday, uponthe appearance of the Great Lakes Navy
Band, under the direction of John Philip Sousa, on tour in interest
of the Liberty Loan campaign. The Four Minutes Speakers of
Mount Vernon and Lisbon, who had been at work for some time, did
much toward the success of the drives. Among them were Dr. Nich-
olas Knight, chairman, who had been in Europe at the outbreak of
the war, Willard C. Stuckslager, the Reverend W. C. Keeler, Prof.
Albert   Keister, Dr. Thos. L. Wolfe, the Reverend Chas. M. Robb,
the Reverend C. C. Dilavou, Prof. _lohn Stout, and Prof. Clyde Tull.
These men gave their speeches at church services, at college chapel,
and before motion picture audiences at the Star Theatre and the Lis-
bon Opera House. The quota for Mount Vernon during the Fourth
Liberty Loan drive was $l24,250, an amount which was over~sub-
scribed $50,000. In so doing, Mount Vernon played her part in the
splendid record set by the state of Iowa, which, in the four drives,
over-subscribed by more than forty million dollars.
During the war years war-gardens were planted, cultivated and
