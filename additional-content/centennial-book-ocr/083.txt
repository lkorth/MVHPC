CORNELL UNDER WILLIAM FLETCHER KING 79
for nearly fifty years, bringing to the campus and the community hosts
of visitors who have been attracted by the distinguished character of
the musical program and the beauty of the surroundings. A list of
artists who have appeared at Festival time includes many of the truly
great in music, but the real claim to distinction has been the continued
presence of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra which made its first
appearance in 1903, directed by Frederick A. Stock, then assistant
director.
The Speech department is the youngest- of the three fine arts
which have flourished on Cornell’s campus. Not until 1875 does the
catalog list a “Professor of Rhetoric and Elocution." Later there was
only an “Instructor in Elocution and Physical Training,” a Combina-
tion which seems a little incongruous. ln 1892 the “School of Ora-
tory and Physical Culture” came into existence with Katherine E.
Oliver as director.
Not until the nineties was there any physical training other than
military drill which held the spotlight from 1874 until 1898 when it
was discontinued following the Spanish American War. ‘In 1890
ropes for climbing, Indian clubs and some simple apparatus were in-
stalled in a make-shift gymnasium which had sawdust on the floor
but no mats or mattresses for some time thereafter. By 1901 there
were full-time directors of physical training for both men and wo-
men. llfliss Mary MacLeod was the woman’s director from 1900 to
1920. In 1902 she Wrote: “Stay .through a lesson and see the girls
bend, turn and poise and jump and travel' on the bar -and turn somer-
saults and climb ropes and then go home invigorated and refreshed
for their mental Work."
On February 11, 1888 the Cornell Athletic Association was
formed, becoming affiliated with the lowa State Inter-collegiate As-
sociation. in ’91, the year in which Cornell participated for the first
time in intercollegiate competition in track and field, tennis and box-
ing and in its first football games with Coe and S.U.I. In ’95 the
C.A.A. was reorganized under faculty supervision to keep down the
use of non~students and professionals on college teams. Since that
time there have been varying degrees of faculty control to enforce eli-
gibility rules.
In 1902-’03 students and townspeople pledged enough money to
hire a football coach for the seasdn. It was not until 1907 that the
college -added a full-time director of athletics to the staff. This first
director was Sherman W. Finger who soon developed one of the most
efficient and complete departments in the 'l\»Iiddle West.
ln connection withthis historical review of nearly fifty years of
Cornell, there is a host of names of Worthy supporters, patrons, faculty
and alumni deserving of mention. To do justice to all of them would
make this chapter a panegyric so only a few can be singled out for spec-
ial mention. William Harmon Norton, of the faculty for sixty-seven
