The coming of the interurban' in july 1914 gave us close con-
nection. with Cedar Rapids, so that exclusive dry goods and shoe stores,
and millinery shops no longer were profitable here, It did, however,
give the irnpetus to paving our Main Street, sincethe grade had to be
established when_ the track was laid. The Iowa Railway and 'Light
Company offered to pay its share of the paving, so the town accept-
ed this offer and laid a good brick pavement throngh the town. This
is now a part of Highway 30, the Lincoln Highway. The original
intention of the Iowa Railway and Light Company was to extend
the line to' Davenport, but Lisbon proved to be the eastern terfninus.
_Interurban service ,was not sufficiently appreciated by Mount
Vernon and Lisbon folks, most of__w_hom owned cars liythis time, so
afterfourteen unprofitable _y¢ai<S,,_ it _was discontinued, Tlielast fun
-was made Saturday, july 28, l928_ It had-brought abont a building
boom between Cedar Rapids ana Mount Vernon, boweverpand city
-folk had begun to establish homes between thertowns, or in Mount
Vernon. 'The building program of Cornell, incident to, its "centennial,
will no doubt- bring inany more to--this bea.utifu'l,_ little hilltop town.
