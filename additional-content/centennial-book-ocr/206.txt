Chapter 18
Recent Yea rs _
'Three earlier chapters of this book, “Pioneer Days,” "A
Chronicle of 'I`wotDecades,” and “Early Developments inthe Incor-
porated Town” were aimed especially to trace the growth of Mount
Vernon from its earliest days through the nineteenth century. The
present chapter will attempt to round out the story of our progress in
the twentieth- century. In particular it will be a complement to the
threads brought out in chapter seven; namely, builders of the town
in the sense of actual constructors, some improvements of this _cen-
tury, recollections of people of the early l9UO’s, and a citation of
individuals who are active in focal points of service in the community
today. _
It seems pertinent that inthe year'1900 ordinance No. 63 gave a
modern touch to the town by changing the names of -the streets.
Washington Street became First Avenue ; Jefferson, Second; Frank-
lin, Third; Penn and Vine, Fourth; Liberty Street, Fifth; and so
on. In keeping with this ordinance was one the next year which re-
quired people to number their houses. Perhaps at this time our coun-
cil wasanticipating the year l9l6 when our post office was to become
second class and we were to have free delivery of our mail.
Mount Vernon has been called a “City of Homes.” The car-
penters of the twentieth century have carried on from where the
early builders, William Braclrett and Marsden Keyes, left off. D. C.
Hartung came to Mount Vernon in the early part of this century.
He built a number of houses here among which are the homes of
Charles Hedges, Dana Stearns, Fred Young, and Mrs. Fred Bau-
man. Succeeding D. C. I-Iartung was Evans Colton. Among others
the homes of Ralph Bachman, Mrs. Helen Schroeder, Frank Cole and
E. R. Ristine were built by Mr. Colton. To Erroll Miller goes
the credit for the houses now occupied by Mrs. ]. M. Holmes, Mrs.
Hattie Miller, Clarence Felsman, a number of artistic cottages at
the Palisades, and the home of Howard Hall on the cliff across the
Cedar.
In the last few years extensive remodeling has been done in town.
Any number of the substantial structures of the earlier decades have
been made into some of the most attractive homes of the community.
Freeman Current, Lawrence Current, and Fred Travis have been
outstanding in this type of workmanship. _Tames Burge has done
carpenter work of a general nature in town for many years. Space
forbids our recounting all of the construction work done by Charlie
