to HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
'Brief comment should be made on the background of our state
history. -Since the -time when Father Marquette, the French mission-
ary and man of good will, and Joliet, the trader, floated down the
Mississippi River to the mouth of the Iowa River, Iowa has been
under three flags-those of France, Spain, and the United States.
The name ‘flowa” comes from a small band of _Indians who roamed
from Lake Michigan to the Missouri River; they ga-ve their name also
to the river flowing to our southwest. According to Anton LeClaire,
the early trader and interpreter for whom-a small town nearby is nam-
ed, they said “loway" when they first saw this region, meaning "this
is the spot.” We lowans agree with their estimate. _
When Jefferson-in 1803 bought all the land west of the Miss-
issippi, the Louisiana Purchase, he remarked to Livingston, the treaty-
-maker, “lt is the_ noblest work of our lives. Vast solitudes will be
changed into flourishing districts with ages of happiness for future
generations.” - - f _
Iowa remained part of Louisiana Territory from 1805 until
1812;-then was in- Missouri Territory from 1812 to 1821. It re-
rnairiedunorganized from 1821 to 1834; was incorporated into Mich-
-igan Territory from 11834-~ to 1836; and into Wisconsin Territory
from 1836 to 1838. It became the Territory of Iowa in 1838, re-
maining suchuntil, 1846, when it was _made a state. Chief Blackhawk
in 1831 had been ordered to carry out a treaty requiring him to move
from what is now Rock Island to the west side of the Mississippi. His
refusal- to do this precipitated the _Blackhawk War. Following this
war, by' purchase of 'land from the Indians, the' settlement of Iowa
became possible. Henry Dodge, later a governor of Iowa, captured
Chief Blackhawk; and Lieutenant- Jefferson Davis, later president of
the Confederacy, removed _'Blackhawk to Jefferson Barracks- near St.
Louis. In the end, _Iowa came into being, and a vast migration began.
Following-ethis,_ Robert- Lucas was appointed -territorial governor
of Iowa. On _December-"1-28, ,194-6, the early home of governor' Lucas
at _-_Iowa ,City -_i»vas; dedicated as a historic spot, the Iowa- State Board
of Conservation having restoredit. Governor _Robert Blue _-presided
at the ceremonies, and the occasion was one of -the 'high lights in
the recent centennia1.ce1`ebration of the State.   ‘
