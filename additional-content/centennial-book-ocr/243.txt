Spanish. American War
The Spanish-American War, being of lesser magnitude and
shorter duration, did not change the way of life of the community
as did World Wars I and II. The young men who entered theser-
vice 'were missed, but one was not conscious at every turn that a war
was on. Uncle.Sam was unprepared for this conflict, so living condi-
tions of the soldiers and sailors were very poor, comparable to those
existing during the Civil War. - '
J oe Bennett says that the four'Nationa1 Guard regiments were
called to Des Moines, and their barracks were the cattle sheds of the
State Fair -grounds. They were busy drilling until _Iune 13, 1898
when they were entrained for Jacksonville, Florida. Therethey
camped in the middle of a swamp and were soon flooded out, but
not until dysentery, malaria, and typhoid fever had taken their toll.
Fortunately _nodeaths of Mount Vernon men occurred While in ser-
vice. Early in December they were brought back to Savannah,
Georgia, _an_d from there they sailed to 'Havana to become' part of the
Army of-Occupation. On ll/Iay l theywere returned' tosavannah
and discharged 'May 13, 1899. - _ 5 -
