At the time of its organizationfMount Vernon was the smallest
town 'in the state to have a Rotary club and possibly the smallest in the
nation. The inter-town club Was approved by Rotary lnternational
with the thought that the whole community would be served better if
the two towns could unite to develop the- community as a Whole.
During its twenty-two years of existence, the local Rotary club
has encouraged the ideal of service as a basis of worthy enterprise;
and, in particular, fostered the development of acquaintance as an op-
portunity for service, high ethical standards in business and professions,
the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations, and the
dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an opportunity to
serve society; the application of the ideal of service by every Rotarian
to his personal, business and community life, and the advancement
of international understanding, good Will, and peace through a World
fellowship of business and professional men united in the ideal of
service.
