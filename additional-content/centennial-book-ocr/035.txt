THE EARLY CHURCHES 35
lots had been purchased from Henry D. Albright, who in company
with William Hayzlett, assumed over one thousand dollars of unpaid
obligations on the church property.
Reference to the old church, built like a 'New England meeting
house, will awaken fond memories in the minds of the older folk.
The front doors opened into a spacious hall. On either side was a
beautiful winding stairway with a carved -walnut rail which led to
the auditorium on the second floor. A gallery in the north end was
built for the choir and was used for this purpose for many years, or
until money could be raised for a platform in the south-east corner
to the right of the high pulpit. To the rninister’s left was the “Amen
Corner" where the Hartsoughs and Chaplain Lozier taught a class of
devout adults who remained through the church service to support
the preacher with their fervent amms.. In this class was one good old
brother, who wore a black wig on Sundays and an older brown one
during the week.
There were three aisles in the old church which were carpeted
in red, a color blending nicely with the red in the frescoed Walls. Ap-
propriately enough, the pulpit had a firmament for a background-
gold starson a wal1_of blue. Light was admitted through high Gothic
type windows of frosted glass in which little stars were etched. The
pulpit furniture consisted of a walnut settee and two armchairs up-
holstered in horse hair, a table, and a lectern. The last two pieces
mentioned are in use in the present church, as is the old organ, a
Mason' and Hamlin, which now serves only as a receptacle for hats
and hymn books in the rear of the auditorium. -
Individual communion service was unknown. Instead, a large
silver goblet, the common cup, was passed from one communicant to
another. A ' `
The seats were low and narrow, the rests reaching only to the
middle of the sitter-’s back. Hinged along the wall were drop seats,
provided for overflow attendance rather than for comfort.
' In the first story were two small classrooms and the lecture room
used for prayer meetings, Sunday school, and Epworth League. Two
large furnaces, opposite each other, were in this room. Thesewere
tended by the faithful caretaker, T. T. Border (Dory, as he was
commonly called). In his farewell address, Dr. Stuntz mentioned
him as having hauled brick for the church. There was no kitchen,
but banquets were often served with no equipment other than that
which could be set-up in the class room.
In the entry was a library of a few hundred volumes. One re-
calls the type of book then considered correct for youthful instruc-
tion' and guidance: The Elsie Dinsmore series, the Pansy books, the
Five Little Peppers, and the works- of Louisa °M. Alcott.
