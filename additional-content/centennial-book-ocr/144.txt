126 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
An art exhibit at the home of Dr. T. A. Gormly was given.
Works of local artists, Prof. I-I. A. Mills, Dr, Gormly, and the fol-
lowing club members, Mrs. Katherine Rush Chambers, Miss Etta
Rowley, and Miss Mattie lsherwood, were shown.
The only local members living are Mrs. Lillian Ristine and
Mrs. Lois Mitchell. e i -
The club was short-lived. ` `
Entre Nous '
Shortly after the turn of the century on September 13, 1902, a
group of young town women met to organize a new literary and social
club. The name Entre Nous was chosen, and Eva Watson (Eno)
was elected the first president.
The membership, limited to twenty-five, is now represented by
both town and college women.
Charter members were:
Anna Alexander (Hann) Lois Mitchell e
Blanche Blackwell Nellie Munson (l\/Ioore) .-
Florence Blackwell (Harris) Anna Belle Rood (Ittner)
Ethelda Burge _ Lillian Smedley (Ristine)
Beulah Crawford (Dill). Cordia Stevenson (Foster)
Ella Ellison Grace Thompson (Johnston)
Mabel Gough (Hogle) Birdie Wade
Mary Hann (Kirkpatrick) Eva Watson (Eno) ~
Laura Hinkley Laura Willix (Merritt) `
Birdie Kepler (Wilson) Grace Wolfe
For a time the custom was followed of presenting a silver dessert
spoon to a prospective bride, and many of these were given during
the first ten years. ` `
'In the earlier years drama and opera were studied, as well as
varied subjects. These years recall the names of Lucy. Boyd, Birdie
Wade, Luella Albrook Miller, and Laura Willix Merritt among its
officers and hostesses. '
Among tl1e many talented literary members are Winifred Van
Etten and (until recently) Laura Hinkley, both authors of national
note.
Some of the members who have made the Entre Nous a
permanent interest in their lives for over a quarter of a cntury in-
clude Florence Mitchell, Belle Bennett,-.Ruby Wade, Nellie Har-
tung, Cordia Bauman, and Helen Hedges.
At all times all worthwhile civic and national projects, _as well as
war work, have received the loyal support of the club.
