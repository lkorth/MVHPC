We' have °sold< our ihouse' and _corner 'lot ‘for _$'l'200L00` and" have
moved out' onthe prairie 'in-ia'one'room'house.“ 'We :are _pretty crowd-
ed. .Chris is_ building -_our newhouse. The cellar wall-is laid and 'thc
'frame is_up. We donit 'build as liighon the -prairie as-in--town. There
willbe one -large roomybedroom, buttery, -clothes--press-.and hall on
the -first'-floor' and -two rooms upstairs. .1'l't’s' .only-_a--_story and ahalf.
The reason -We moved before th_e`house'was finished, it was-too far for
Benjamin to go night and "morning, Chris’s live in' a nearby shack.
When' her baby was born, 'I 'took care of -her, saving them both bills
for Doctor and hired girl. Ann Alida cares for -the baby -like _an old
grandmother.   our--t'imber is near; Benjamin'-is_¢busy -getting out
rails and posts _for-fencing. We`_plante_dl_a-_lot'~of-Walnut_.ar1d5 locust

little of Peter- Cartrightg as’-he'»always stopped for a visit.
_ At times," I -felt rather badly about' moving again,#Ebut It-believe -it
is -for the best. Benj amin- thinks that he can' make -more fby -improving
his fprairie farm than”'hy staying'_in~_toWn.' Mother Ford sent Ann
Alida and 'I each afdelaine dress. ' They are =_' striped and -veryrich col-

_se_nt- me an autographed copyof one of 'her "books, The -girls are very
