Family Letters, 1854-1863
These letters, Written by Mrs. Benjamin Ford to her parents and
sisters in New York during theyears 1854-1863, were collected by
Margaret 'Paul decades later while visiting relatives in New York
State. They were made available for publication in this volume
through the kindness of Mrs. Harriet Clarke of Marshalltown,
daughter of the author. The Ann Alida of the letters was the mother
of Charles 'Paul of Mount Vernon and an aunt of Mrs; E. M. Gill.
She attended the Seminary at' Mount Vernon for a-time and also
worked in the general store kept by her grandfather, Elias Ford, who
movedfrorn Schenectady, New York in' 1867-three years after the
last of 'these letters wasrwritten. Two years later he traded his _stock
of goods for a farm in- Franklin Township north of town, later
known as the Albert Ink farm, where he lived until his death in 1379.
He remodeled the original farm home and put a stone basement under
the barn.- ' _ _ 1 _
Mrs. Clarke has deleted the more personal parts of these letters,
leaving a vivid first-hand, sometimes home-sick picture of life on the
prairies in the Fifties and early Sixties. ' '
_ October IO, 1854
Dear Parents and All, C
After a long and weary journey we arrived at Mt. Vernon Sun-
day, October 7.' Benjamin didn’t expect us so soon and was out in the
thicketgathering wild plums. They rang the dinner bell, and,
knowing what had happened, he was not long reaching the house.
Our journey to Chicago was tiresome and uneventful. The girls
got very tired and wanted “To go back East.” When we reached
Chicago a cholera epidemic was raging. Father Ford took us to a
tavern and wouldrftiallow us to leave our room while he bought a
wagon and two .fine black horses. As you know we loaded our house-
hold, goods and came by the Erie Canal by way of the Great Lakes to
Chicago. Father went to the kitchen and personally supervised the
scalding of our dishes and preparation of our food which was prin-
cipally crackers and boiled -milk. .lt was three rather wearisome days
before he had completed his purchases and had our goods loaded. You
can well imagine how happy we were to end such an unhappy exper-
ience, Ann Alida and Mary chattering all the way “Now we'l1 see
Papa.” Some of the roads were terribly rough and some days we
drove until after dark to reach a tavern, and often drove for hours
