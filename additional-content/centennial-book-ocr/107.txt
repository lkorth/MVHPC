The Turn of the Century
_ The mammoth wheel of time, Which is supposed 'to make _a 'corn-
plete revolution every ecenturypseemed to 'slow down 'at the close of
the 90’s.as if loath to leave behind many of the good 'old customs and
traditions of the past. The pause was brief, however, for its speed was
soon accelerated and the twentieth century ushered in a"period 'of ex-
pansion and rapid growth for Mount Vernon. °
The 'town could ‘boast by this time 'all "the so-called' modern im-
provements-that is, electric lights, _Water works, and, 'by 'the second
Week `in._Tanuary 1900, the telephone. The latter service was offered
on Sundays only from 7' to 10 A.l\/I. and from 2 to' 6 P.l\/I. Other
days the service 'Was from 6 A.l\fI. to 10 P.l\/I; Considering that the

phones three dollars a month? u ' ' ~
Since 1900 we have gone far in telephone equipment, service,
and excellence. By _Tanuary 1940, new central office equipment was
placed in operation in Cedar. Rapids and: the very latest in dial tele-
phones in~l\/lount_Vernon.' This meant that the old magnetic phones
were to be just a memory. ' _ _ ' 9 i

the following officers: President, James E." Harlan; Vice-President,
E. B. Willix; Secretary, Ur; T. A. Gormlyj Treasurer,   B. Al-

E. B. Willix, W. A. Smyth, Dr. T. A. Gorrnly, James   Harlan,
Dr. J. B. Robinson, W. E. Platner and Dr. A.   Tenney.
Our local company was sold first to the' Cedar Rapids and Mar-
ion Telephone Company, which prior to VVorld War l sold out to
the lowa Telephone Company, a part of the Bell System. It became
a part of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company in 1909.
The curfew, which -in the lat_e 90's compelled those_ under four-
teen years of age to be off the streets by 1.0 P.l\/I., had been done away
