The Ladies’ Aid Society was organized in 1854 and held sociables
every two weeks. It was re-organized in 1867 and set to Work raising
money for repairing the second church. It met casually until 1896,
when it began to work in earnest. Mrs. Alonzo Collin was the first
president and Mrs. Clara Brackett Smith became president in 1898.
It held a carnival, llflrs. ]arley’s Wax works,, a district school, a
weekly food sale, and a concert by the University of Chicago Glee
Club Which netted over $24-l. _When the new church was ready,
$4,000 of needed funds came from the Ladies’ Aid. _l\irs. Smith
served for twenty-four years in all as president and Mrs. Barrett for
over seven years. It has helped every department of the church and
the parsonage, wiring the church in 1917 at a cost of $1,500 giving
$5,000 after the fire of 1924, and$5,000 to the Cornell College cam-
paign of 1928. They have baked regiments of pies, spread banquets
and suppers innumerable, and, best of all, sustained the comradeship,
loyalty, and solidarity that make the morale ofchurch life. In fifty
years, they have contributed over $50,000. The society has a number
of fifty-year members who well remember the Old Brick Church.
Mrs. C. W. Kepler and Mrs. lVIartha Keyes, members for approxi-
mately seventy years, came to Mount Vernon in 1866 when the church
was but a year old. Mrs. Mary Burr Norton, who is still interested
and loyal, probably _holds the record for the longest continuous mem-
bership, seventy-seven years. l
The Women’s Missionary Society dates back to the early sev-
enties. Mrs. Burr, Mrs. Guild, Mrs. Celia Phillips, and 'Miss Har-
riette I. Cook were among the early presidents. Later, Mesdames
Blackwell, Lozier, Albrook, C. W. Kepler, Albright, and Miss Hynd-

Rigby was president in later years and a long-time Conference Presi-
dent Mrs. Thomas Nicholson Was national president of the Woman’s
Foreign Missionary Society, the founder and first president of the
World Federation of Methodist Women.
In 1890, a junior society was formed, called the “Busy Bees” of
which Luella Albrook Miller was the first president. This organiza-
tion has changed from time to time into the “Young Ladies’ Mission-
ary Society,” and the “Elizabeth Pearson Auxiilary” and- the “Wes-
leyan Service Guild.” ` .
