At the first meeting of the lodge held under dispensation Oc-
tober 29, l857,"the petitions of seven men were received,'all of whom
became master' masons. They were Thomas McFarland, James B.
Gordon, Lucius A. Weeks, John G. I-Iazlett, Edward S. Bargelt,
Noah McKean, and Abraham R. Knott. Within seven months after
October 29, nineteen men were initiated, and in order-to confer all
these degrees, sessions 'were often held morning, afternoon, and eve-
ning.
f They occupied the upstairs of the Waln building, over what is
now the pool hall, corner of First Street and First Avenue. In 1860
they moved to_the third floor of the building then owned by F. L.
and A. R. Knott, 'now the Electric Light Building.
On the morning of _Tune 24, 1859, they elected new officers,
and at 2:00. P.-M. that day, accompanied by the brass band, marched
to the old college chapel where they held a public installation.

a sword captured from the forces of Santa Anna at Mexico City in
1847, this sword to be the property ofthe lodge forever. _

The old Waln building was burned in_1879 and _was replaced in
1881 by a brick structure now known as the Keedick Building. At
this time the lodge again leased the second floor and remained there
until 1915. At that time they rented the second floor of the build-
ing then ownedby ]` _ G. Fox, once known-as Wilcox Hall. In 1933
this building was purchased by the Masons and remodeled.
