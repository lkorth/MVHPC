a chapel building. Up to this time daily chapel exercises were held in
Old Sem or the Main building. The impression prevailed in the pub-
lic mind that money was available for this venture; but this Was un-
true, not a dollar being in sight. President King found on his hands
the task of arranging for solicitation of this fund. ln the spring
of 1875 arrangements for a canvass were completed and the work
begun. Fifteen thousand dollars had to be in hand before any actual
building was to be undertaken. As an increased incentive, the salary
of the president was raised to $2,000, three members of the Board
assuming the increase for a period of five years. Then, as once before
came a financial depression, that of the late 70’s.
During the perilous and hectic days of 1875-’77 the first story
of the chapel building was erected and sufficient money was found to
pay for it. The auditorium stood unfinished and windows were
boarded up for five years more. In 1882 Dr. King went into the
field determined to complete this building, and he obtained $17,000,
making the total cost of the building about $72,000.
A glorious occasion was the commencement of 1882. The guest
of honor was the founder, Dr. George B. Bowman, who came from
California. Others present wereiA1pha J. Kynett of the Board of
Church Extension, coming from Philadelphia; Professor David H.
Wheeler, now editor of The Metfzodist in New York City; Professor
Stephen N. F ellows, from' the State University; Harriette I. Cooke,
superintendent of a Medical Mission in Boston; and Bishop Matthew
Simpson who was the orator of the occasion. Dr. King says of this
that it “was memorable as the last gathering of early friends and the
trimphant consummation of the long and agonizing struggle of chapel
erection.”
In the spring of 1873 Dr. King had been so seriously ill that he
wished to retire from 'his office. The trustees accorded him a year’s
leave of absence with pay and suggested the trip abroad. During his
absence Dr. Hugh Boyd, professor of Latin, was acting president
and a dormitory, called the Cornell College Boarding Association, was
erected. It is now known as South Hall.
With improvements in business conditions throughout the
country, Cornell College enjoyed comparative prosperity. Acreage
was added to the campus by purchase of the Goodell Farm in 1891,
of twenty acres from the Ash Estate in 1892, and the erection of more
buildings. Bowman Hall dormitory for women came in 1885, the
Carnegie Library in 1904 and the Alumni Gymnasium in 1909. ln
a contribution to the Historical Society of Linn County in 1904 Dr.
Norton wrote: “In these forty years Cornell has grown so that now
it has a campus of fifty-five acres, six buildings, nearly 800 students,
more than 1000 graduates, an annual income of $50,000 and assets
all told of over $900,000." ln 1892 Cornell stood out as the largest
church college in the United States west of Chicago. Dr. Norton
