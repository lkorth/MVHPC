FARMS AND FARMING _151
very home now owned by Rudolph Notbohm. Singing schools and
spelling beeswere great social events in these school houses. _ _
- Barn raisings, taffy pulls, hobsled -rides, .and hay rides, .together
with charivaris, skating parties, quilting bees and oyster slippers have
now given way to evenings of profitable entertainment with _educa-
tional programs in night schools, county fairs, anniversary celebra-
tions, farm -auctions, .and picnics. In ,summer the Kepler Palisades
State 'Parkis now the popular resort.
' There was 'a"tin1e-when ruralneighbors rarely savvthe inside of
one another's homes. Now _the innumerable farm clubs malce for corn-
munity interest and action along social lines. Grange Hall is a land-
marlt recalling the brief life of the local grange inthe eighties. Elmer
Neal was secretary. The building was donated to Linn Township
as an election hall and was used as a school house until 194-6. In the
early nineties the Farmt-:r's Alliance was organized west of town, of
which _Ioe Smyth was president and D. W. Ford was secretary. Its
purpose was co-operative buying. A Farm Improvement Association
was hegun in l9l-4, with Ben Neal as president for Franklin Town-
ship; and Charles Travis for Linn Township. Later, in l9l9, this
became the Farm Bureau, which is a nationwide organization with
the goal of improvement of agriculture. The 4-H clubs are a major
activity, and they develop skilled leadership in the highest degree.
Other co-operative projects through the years have been hog vac-
cination, alfalfa growing, fruit-tree pruning, seed corn testing, and
the use of lime and commercial fertilizers. In l9lS l\’Iiss Hazel
Spencer, Home Demonstration Agent, inaugurated adult education
courses especially for women, and these today constitute the only na-
tion-wide projects of their kind. The Shipping Association of Farm-
ers Was organized in 1918 and did as high as a quarter of a million
dollars Worth of business per year. Henry Clark and John Dew were
managers. It ceased, however, with the advent of the road truck.
The progress of farming has not been easy through the years, for
in former days grasshoppers swarmed over the country with devastat-
ing power. Then there was the cinch-hug menace in 1934- and 1935.
There were the seasons when army worms traveled in rlroves, and
times of cholera outbreaks; and there were the drought years lilre ’34
and '36 when even “Democrat hay" (foxtail) was in demand. The
toiling farmers went unrewarded and many had to lose their farms.
In 1946 Iowa was first in the value of hogs, corn, grain, eggs and
horses produced. The marketing of grain-fed cattle and of poultry,
red clover seed, timothy seed, honey and bees-wax ranked the state
first in the nation. 'On the human and social side Iowa stands first
in amount of grade-A land and per cent of improved land, and also in
literacy. The vision of the pioneers has come true; Iowa is the land
flowing with milk and honey.
