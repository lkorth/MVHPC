'A French woman who was tou1iin'g~America recently saw afbeau-

“That is not-.a-cast-l-e,f’ he '-replied-; “That is aihigh school.”
Down' at the ward building today the`1ittleesecondZ'graders who
are studying about Indians are- molding pottery, drawing picturesioi
wigwams, and practicing lndian dances-. 'Children in- an intermediate
group,--studying about- France, are looking up stories. of artists and
writers of France. Other boys and girls are' reading purely for de-
light-pioneer stories, fiction, scientific stories of the planets, stories
of insect life or-animal stories. _ r _
At the high -school, our castle on the summit of _Hardsscrabble
Hill, the pupils in the science classesare attending a movie on vol`can-
oes in action. In the English room a practice teacher has brought
irons the college' three -major .students in dramatics who are present-
ing scenes :irorri “She Stoops to Conquer” to the twelfth grade Eng-
lish class. The girls i_n the domestic science room are at work on
bright colored dresses. The "gym", is an uproar of hoys practicing
basketball. Upstairs in the commercial room a few are preparing the
Week’s issue of Chalk Mark. _- “There’s a song in the.air,’f~ too. The
ubiquitous music pupils are in every available niche for practice-a
vocal group here, a string quartet-there. That agonizing gasp escap-'
ing from the math room is just a junior-high lad practicing “Three
Blind l\»1ice" and his -French-horn; `
Such are our Nlount Vernon' schools during this' centennial
year--high school boys dressed' in bright plaid shirts, their hair sleek
with scented oil, and high schoolgirls wearing sweaters, bobby-sox,
and moccasins, their hair hanging to their shoulders _and _brushed to a
beautiiullustre. \They are'strong,straighbforward, and trustworthy.
They are happy-hearted, eager, and confident. They- are all set 'to
start. theisecond; century of- our`schools.= y
