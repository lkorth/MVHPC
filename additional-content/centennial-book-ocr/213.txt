Mount Vernon Hawkeye-Record' and the Lisbon- Herald. After the
death of- his‘tather in October 1925 and 'ai few months- after his grad-
uation'from‘ cm-sell, james W.-MeCutcheon became the editor' of the
paper', ca position-'he holds-today. At the end of “depot street” John
Klijno-' is on; duty- asi-the “one and-only” station agent of the`Chicago
and-North~We'stern Railway- in the town since' 1.911-
'Clarence Felsman, at 116 Second Avenue, South, has represent-
ed Albert’s Cleaners"of Cedar Rapids, since' 1931.
Several other people in town not heretofore mentioned are car-
rying on at' important posts. Mrs. Don Pringle, who was in- the
grocery' business from- 1933 to 1942, has done"a 'lively .real estate busi-
ness the past two years. Walter Kohl has been a fuel oil dealer con-
nected with the'-Best Oil Company of Lisbon since -1933. Julian
Johnston is the truck salesman for the-Linn Cooperative company
(1938). Emil Reyhons has been 'in charge of the bulk plant of the

cigar has -provided taxi service for the -townspeople since 1932; A. J.
Bobst’s vocation as interior' decorator' dates §rorn3l916.-
To*one acquainted with the town the' -abovelist scarcely seems
complete *without"the'rnention of three lateibusiness men who we-re
here for so- many years: Anson'Bu1‘ge, a member of one of' the earliest
families, helped many Ia townsman out of~~dif'ficulties by his prof-i-table
sales as an jauctioneer from 1916 to 1945. John Kyle, also of -a pioneer
'family inthe Linn-Grove area, was in the real estate and insurance
business from the 1920's to 1945. 'George Wilson was an attorney
from 1901 to 1945.
The Mount --Vernon Chamber of Commerce expresses the- spirit
of the townspeople in the recognition it gives to its fifty-year business
men. A' few years ago the organization 'honored John Hoodmaker,
drayman, expressman, and -driver of the hack in the horse and lbuggy
days. Anybody who is “seasoned timber” in Mount Vernon recalls
thebumpy rides in-the old 'hack with -its steel-rimmed wheels u_p
-the steep, 'stony 'hill from the depot. The occasion celebrating  
Hoodmalcersretirement was a fine banquet during which -he was
presented a generous purse and an elaborate-diploma from the Univer-
sity of Hard Knocks. -
More 'recently the Chamber of Commerce honored a group -of
fifty-year business men. Among 'them were Will Hoover, -the fjew-
eler, 'whose family has 'long been an integral 'part of the community,
]oe Bennett, the-druggist, formerly an all-around athlete in the col-
l'ege,iTom Wolte,; genial pioneer and doctor, 'the late “Doc” Mitchell,
rnayor, town -clerk, _and water superintendent for-many' years, Jasper
-Bloom, 'successor of W. G. Power in the book-store and-member of the
town band, 'and the late Harry--Gilliland, 'dry-goods 'merchant 'and
coal dealer.
