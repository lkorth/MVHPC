The Guy Nineiies
Were the Gay N ineties gay? Certainly they were not by mod-
ern standardswhen a gay time implies dining, dancing, driving and
drinking rather than an evening at home with nothing more exciting
than a game of authors or parchesi. Although we are inclined to
smile atuthe decorum of. the times, at the ornate literary style, at the
ginger-bread decoration of their housm, we feel a kinship with the
spirit of advancement in thought which marked this transition period
from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries. Live currents were
moving which brought about sweeping changes in economics, govern-
ment and literature. ln Mount Vernon, as in the country as a Whole,
this decade is of interest because of the similarity of their problems to
those of half a century later. The cultural life of the town, although
formal by 1947 standards, was of a high order. Out of it stemmed the
important musical, civic, literary and social elements which combined
to make Mount Vernon what it is today.
Were the young people of the nineties gay? The solemn faces
which stare bac!-: at us from picturesof high school graduating classes
do not look so. Handle-bar mustaches had a way of making young
faces lookcornical, as did cadey ll£llIS_W0fl'\ by gentlemen. Perhaps it
was the pointed shoes or high celluloid collars which mused the look
of pained surprise. Striped socks and button shoes completed a cos-
tume for men which arouses amusement today as we look at faded
photographs of the period.- _
With girls the contrast betweenold and new styles is even more
striking. Probably at no time in history has a costumebeen designed
which camouflaged the feminine form more completely. Bustles,
capes, lg-o-muttonsleeves, “guimpes, gussets and gores”-all seem
created for the purpose of concealing the natural contours. Yet the
total effect was so charming that the Gibson Girl became the symbol
of the times, a model to which styles retum in regular cycles. After
half a century of changing styles we call it the “New Look."
'Before the coming of the dressmalrer for her spring and fall
rounds of sewing in the home, the house-wife bought bolts of material,
yards of brush braid, whale-bone waist-band, paper muslin and crino-
line to make skirts stand out properly. This invasion of the home by
the dress-maker was almost as upsetting to the family routine as the
annual-spring-cleaning. ' - '
Hats which topped off a high pompadour or were skewered to
the Psyche Knot by jeweled hat-pins were of such commanding sine
