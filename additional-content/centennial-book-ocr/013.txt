PIONEER DAYS 15
_ That old Military Road running from Iowa City to Dubuque
through Ivanhoe had its origin when W. W. Chapman, Territorial
Delegate to Washington, D.C., secured in 1840 the passage of a bill
providing $20,000 for its construction. Along the road, running
through the present site of Mount Vernon, villages and towns were
founded, of which few now remain. In the early days Anamosa and
Fairview were prominent hostels; and travellers along the road gazed
with delight at the unending prairies, agreeing with Asa Whitney, a.
northern Iowa pioneer, who declared in 1846: “This is the finest
country on the globe, capable of sustaining three times the population
of any other place. Nowhere is the atmosphere so pure, the
surface so gently' undulating, or the soils so rich, with not one acre of
bad land."
Soon four-horse stage-coaches of the Western Stage Company
traveled the road, and in the forties they carried members of the legis-
lature to the Capitol building in Iowa City. No doubt Governor
Ansel Brigg’s couriers could have been seen dashing by at top speed on
horseback. Home-steaders on foot and horseback and in white-topped
immigrant wagons traveled on their way to stake out homesteads.
Occasionally a troop of U.S. Dragoons formed a colorfulcavalcade
in contrast to some lonely circuit-rider with saddlebags making his
way prayerfully to his scattered appointments. '
It seemed as though the`leading city in these parts would be lo-
cated on that Military Road. Naturally it ought to be laid out in
the fertileland of the river bottom where, at the same time, river
'traffic would greatly increase trade and commerce. Steamboats came
up the river in early days and flathoats were launched with loads of
grain and furs destined for St. Louis-in Missouri. _ i
John Wolfe saw the possibilities at Ivanhoe and settled- in
1839 on the north side of the river, building a hotel and starting a
ferry. e He was the first justice of the peace in the county. After his
death in 1854 his sons Dan D. and S. W. continued to operate the
ferry until a bridge was built in 1370. Part of this bridge was Wash-
ed away in the floods of 1876, and the ferry had to be re-opened for
a year. It is interesting to view -the original -log cabin of the Wolfev
family a short distance south of the present Ivanhoe bridge. This
cabin was built in 1340, an addition with siding was made about ten
years_ later, and the adjacent farmhouse was built in l360. In part-
nership with his sons, Richard B. and Dan T., Dr. Thomas Wolfe
owns a large tract of land including the homestead which bears a
100-year-farm plaque.
It was on that old ferry at Ivanhoe in the fifties that ]acob
Slosser, grandfather of Raymond Mallie, was transporting a load of
oxen when they were frightened by the swirling waters and broke
loose, plunging into theriver. Jacob, however, kept them company
and ultimately landed them at Stony Point.
