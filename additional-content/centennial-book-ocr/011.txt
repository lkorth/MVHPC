PIONEER DAYS 13
torial' delegate from Missouri, who helped sponsor Iowa statehood.
The first white settler of the county was William Abbe, whose cabin
was located near the creek which has since borne his name. This lo-
cation was about two miles west of Mount Vernon, near the present
Lincoln Highway, U.S. No. 30. A handsome marker, gift of the
Daughters ofthe American Revolution chapters of the county, was
erected near the site and dedicated in 1937 with appropriate ceremon-
ies. _
Abbe was a man who stood head and shoulders above -the set-
tlers of those days; tall, thin, spare, and energetic in every action. He
came from Elyria, Ohio, crossing the Mississippi in 1836, using the
winter ice to save a toll charge, and staked out his cabin claim along
the bank of the creek. Then he returned to Ohio to bring his family.
He arrived in April 1837 and built a double-sized log cabin. His wife
was reputed an excellent cook, having on hand always barrels of honey
gathered from bee-trees. Travellers and surveyors went miles out of
their way in order to eat at her table. She died in 1839 and is buried
on the original Abbe homestead. Once when she and her sister drove
to Dubuque in the winter to get grain, the horse died enroute, and a
terrible blizzard came on. _ They would have been lost but for a tin1e~
ly light in the cabin of a sick settler on the' prairie. _Abbe was elected
to the Iowa legislature, and he was also one of the promoters of a
plank road in 1849 which linked Muscatine to Tipton, from that
continuing west. ` 1
Daniel Hahn was probably the first settler of the nearby Mount
Vernon community. He came in March of 1837 and built a cabin
a short distance below the site of the present stone quarry. Often
there would be visitors to keep over night, sometimes as many as fif-
teen at one time in that '12 by 14 foot cabin. Mrs. Hahn, a versatile
woman, acted the part of a doctor in bringing the babies of the neigh-
borhood into the world. She was widely known for her helpfulness to
those in need. Their grandson, the popular long-time mayor of Cedar
Rapids, Frank K. Hahn, inherited the family hunting rifle of those
days, which hangs in his Cedar Rapids residence. ~ _ -
C. C. Haskins, a bachelor, settled at almost the same time a half
mile east of the cemetery. He married some years later and -moved
into town, building what is known as the Iorns House, now the Mr.
and Mrs. james W. McCutcheon residence. Many Qld-timers recall
the little iron fence in the cemetery that used -to set apart the plot of
this early family. '
By_l838 settlers began to arrive in force, in that year there being
in the community about fifty. The Donahues settled near the site of
Lisbon; Asher Edgerton went two miles West of town, near 'the Mc-
Affertys, Silas Hammond and Hiram Beales. f Thomas Craig, known
as the first rural Methodist, later bought out Edgerton. William
