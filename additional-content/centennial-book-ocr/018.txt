Philip ‘Stinger boughtland _-near _Linn Grove, while J .   'Wal-
ton and James Barkley 'staked out claims in Yankee Grove. (Lisbon
was called Yankee Grove -because an early settler C. "C. Haskins, a
Yankee, owned a -large area of land there.) ` A tall and heavy-set
mechanic in the person of Richard Harbert came to town. He was-
most useful in many of the appointive offices of the town and com-
rnunity. = .. _ ~
' “In 184-3 -Presbyterians and Methodists alike began holding meet-
ing -in members’ cabins. ‘The Presbyterians (New School) used John
Stewart’s 'cabin on the Palisades road, the' Covenanter Presbyterians
met in the Smyth home, and the Methodists worshipped in the home of
Thomas Craig, the first rural l\/Iethodist, who was located at Sugar
Grove two miles wect of town.
The winter of 1843 was a severe pioneer winter. Snow drifted
to twenty-one feet deep, lying all winter on the fields. The thermom-
eter at times registered thirty degrees blow zero, and the shivering set-
tlers in their not too Winter-proof cabins had difficulty in keeping
warm. It was impossible to go to the mill for flour, for the tracks
made in walking filled with snow almost immediately. Occasionally
settlers were found frozen on the _Way from the barn to the house in
a raging blizzard.

Since 1838 country schoolhouses had supplied the need for edu-
cation. At this time there Were schools at Yankee Grove, St. Mary’s,
and Linn Grove. In the school lists We read the names of well-
known families: Scott, Varner, Vlfhitlatch, Tyron, Iordan, Caraway,
and Stinger. During the year 184-4 five families united to build the
Abbe schoolhouse two miles west of town. Fourteen years later, in
1858, it was rebuilt in brick, and after sixty years of valiant service
it is now retired and is being used as a private home. These school-
houses were centers -of community- activity of every- kind, on Sundays
being used for services of Worship, and 'on weekday evenings for sing-
ing schools and spelling- bees. Within their Walls 'three _'generations
