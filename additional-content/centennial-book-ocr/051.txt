shoulders for our summer meat. Have seen no dried beef since we
used the last that we brought from the east. Benjamin says that we’ll
have some next year. Before we came out here Benjamin offered Mr.
Ash $45.00 per acre for his lots. There are also ten acres of white
oak timber; it lays just two miles from here and can be bought for
two hundred dollarsfeand timber is _very scarce here. Before we
moved here the Collins’ were all settled in their new home. She is a
tiny woman and a fine' housekeeper and cook, Chris and Henrietta
vi_sited them Sunday. ` , ' `
We had a terrible blizzard last week. The snow came _spatter-
ing on the stove and the wind blew, and the roof creaked like it would
go every minute. I was nearly frightened to death. We.were nearly
a mile from the nearest neighbor and would have been lost if we had
tried to reach them. We decided if the roof blew off that we would
get under the bed and wait for morning, but providence spared us,--
but we hadno sleep. The' barn where Benjamin keeps his horses was
half a mile away and he fought his way through five foot drifts to
feed them. But as much as we suffered, we fared better than many
who were caught away from home and soon found the roads and
trails blotted out--and several lost their lives. lt"was hard- on birds
and wild _game and hundreds were frozen. Just as soon-.as the roads
were open, Benjamin moved us to. Mt.‘Vernon, but it will be some
time before he_ can bring in the cattle and feed. The snow is very
deep. Fred Staab, whose place is near ours, is working for us. He
has a brother Chris. -- ~
° lt’s spring again andthe cruel winter is at an end. We moved
out on the prairie into our new house two weeks -ago. It is still un-
plastered, but will have it done as soon as the crops are all in. I
planted 'cabbage and tomato seed in boxes in April and the plants are
large enough to set out. I have been working very hard, -getting set-
tled, and a big wash and ironing, and making garden. r
The wheat begins to look green and beautiful. Our garden is
up and it looks like We would have an abundance of early things.
Benjamin has planted both kinds of melons. Tell the girls they must
let me know how they make dresses for little girls. I have had my
summer_ bonnet made over and it looks very nice. lt is fine white
straw trimmed in white and it cost $5.00. ' ' ~
  'N You asked- me' if l am' making cheese. nl don't think that I’1l
undertake it until next summer. We milk eight cows and ‘butter is
25 cents per pound. Ham and _lard are 20' cents and very' scarce.
Chris has only what we give him, but we have hired help and use
much more than usual.   ' '
