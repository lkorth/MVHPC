It is a severe penalty. Up to now the cost_amounts_to_$_1,0_QQ,000,QO(},
and that does not include tlieewear and tear on people’s' mindsengag-
ed in industrial pursuits. __ Tliecountry is drifting asa ship at"sea
with no compass. Experienees comes high.” Another _editorial inthe

- _ _ Thereiwere three di'sastrous_~fires in_ -1893. which destroyed parts
of two business blocks on _Main Street- _This led to a popular demand
for a fire department.  the Hawkeye _of 'January 3, l_896,_~an irate
citizen wrote an open letterito the _mayor and council demanding' acl-
tion on ielectricity, a water'_syst_ern and other improvements' needed
to' make Mount Vernon attractive to would-be settlers.   hisworcls:
“What a mortifying sight met the gaze of our people atour last fire
when the newbeautiful residence of Mr. and Mrs. Leila' was on fire-
the drayman hooking up his_ team to' draw _water from the faithful
