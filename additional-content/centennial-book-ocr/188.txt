168 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
- The pattern of the May Music Festival has remained much
the same through the yearwrecitals by artists of distinction, a choral
work accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, two con-
certs by the Orchestra, teas, sociability, garden tours, lilacs and fruit
trees in bloom and the lighted chapel against themoonlight. Presi-
dent and Mrs. Cole have added the popular "coffee after the con-
cert” at the White House on Saturday _evening for patrons and friends
of the Festival. ` ` p
Among the artists presented at Festival time have been Schumann
Heink, Josef Hoffman, Leopold Godowsky, Campanari, Marian
Anderson, Dorothy_'_l\/Iaynor, Lotte Lehmann, Richard Crooks, and
a host of the great personalities in music. From his first appearance
in 1903 until his death in 1942, Dr. Stock continued '-to pay his an-
nual visit to Cornell, conducting a total of 112 concerts for the 'Fes-
tival. He was always greeted by astanding audience and it was-as
if old friends had met. On the occasion of the. twentyvfifth visit of
the Orchestra to the community, the collegeconferred an honorary
Doctor of hfusic degree on Doctor Stock and presented gifts to him
and Mrs. Stock. The people of the town banqueted the Orchestra
players ‘in the American Legion Hall. .hlany of these men had ¢re-
turned' year after year to the same l\{lount Vernon homes for lodging
and welcome.. - A Stock memorial fund of $112,000 is being raised
under the joint chairmanship of l\'Irs. Russell Cole and hflrs. Errol
hdillery _ `
Because of annual' visitsof Vaclav Jislrra, head of the string bass
section, to the John Klimo home, John the younger, went to the Jislrra
home to study the big instrument. He is now a regular member of
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and since 1945 has been on the
roster of players for the Festival, greeting his fellow orchestra mem-
bersat the “Buttermilk Party” which has long been an annual event
in the hospitable Klimo home. _ _ `
'The quiclcening of the times, changes in mode of transportation
and the dulling of glamor on some of our most cherished heritages
have left -their mark on the Festival. Dr. Norton’s garden, so freely
shared, no-longer flaunts its beauty on the southern slope and the
magic of,Dr. Stock’s presence is only a memory-yet the Festival
remains an established and beloved institution. _ `
Another college department long- popular with the people of
Mount Vernon is the Little Theatre, known at different_tirnes as
the department of Oratory, Debate and Public Speaking. Since the
coming of Albert F. Johnson and his-wife, Bertha French Johnson,
Dramatic Art has held the spotlight. Before their coming in_ 1932,
for a number of years the most significant dramatic offering wasthe
annual presentation of a Shakespeare play by “Toppy” and Jewell
Tull. Before the erection of Armstrong Hall in 1937 these and other
