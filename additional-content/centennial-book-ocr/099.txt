There was great local_enthusiasm for McKinley as was proven by
the l\€[cKinley Club and Women’s auxiliary which sprang up in july
of 1897. The town went en masse to hear him make a scheduled
speech at the station. By accident the train pulled out just as he was
beginning: “l\/ly fellow citizens,” thereby disappointing hundreds Of
