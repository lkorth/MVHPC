24 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
'I853
This year will be remembered as. of utmost importance since it
records the founding of the Iowa Conference Seminary, as detailed
in another chapter. Immigration into Iowa reached a high peak.
Among the community activities there were new business enterprises,
such as the venture of George Camp in opening a factory for the
manufacture of wagons. A local election was held in Mr. Walnâ€™s
store at which N. W. McKean was elected the first justice of the
peace. I
Oliver Day and Iohn Wilds, who afterward became a colonel
in the Civil War, opened stores in the Ellison block. The Tedford
brothers opened a store on the south side of Main Street. Elder
Bowman laid .out an addition to the town between the present Meth-
odist Church and the college property, and there he constructed a
tavern for the accommodation of travelers, which later became known
as Guild Hotel. `
Some new arrivals destined to become prominent came into the
community. Among them were B. F. Beach, N. U. Ballard. _loab
Lacock, and Andrew Hayzlett. Augustus Bauman, father of editor
Simon H. Bauman, came this year and built the brick house at the
south edge of town, now the Al Morrissey home on Route No. 261.

The movement westward had been accelerated in recent years,
with many immigrants crowding in to take up the new government
lands. hdount Vernon enjoyed a business expansion which was grat-

north side of D/lain Street, again moving to a new store on the site
of the Iowa Electric Light and Power Company. Dr. Pease came
in with a drug store on the south side of the street. He built a brick
house still standing on the right side of the road entering the town
from the south. Morgan L. Ink brought goods from the East and
opened a general store; he also built a new sawmill. His remodeled
brick building at the 'northeast corner of First Street and Second
Avenue, the Hawkeye corner, is pictured in this boolc. S."K. Young,
father' of George`Young, Sr., came this year, as did A. G. Neff, -Wil-
liam McFarland, Andrew Beatty and A. E. Goodyear. Possibly
among the most notable additions was the furniture and craft fac-
tory of J. T. Oldham near the present bank building.

the college, William Hallock, founded .the ll/lount Vernon Ledger.
It hadia precarious existence ; the real newspaper was yet to come.
