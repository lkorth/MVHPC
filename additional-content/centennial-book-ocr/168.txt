14-S HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
and Franklin Corn Club was organized in 1904. It is still going
strong. W. T. Fawcett was one of the leaders in this movement.
In the late twenties hybrid corn replaced the open-pollinated
variety and greatly increased the annual yield. Around 1920 E. S.
Johnston, auctioneer, and Harry Siggins began raising pop-corn, the
former planting as much as 200 acres in one season. This was ship~
ped out by the carÂ»load. Alfalfa was tried in 1913 by Henry Clark,
southeast of town, and it gave as much as three cuttings in aseason.
E. C. Forest in 1915 engaged in this enterprise also.
The Sargent Farms of more than 1000 acres, north of the rail-
road, owned by the late president of the Chicago Sc North Western
Railway, conducted extensive experiments with soy beans. R. P. Ink
first experimented with soy beans from Ames in 1906. They were
at first planted with corn as silage, then used as a hay crop, and now
they have become a major grain crop grown to meet the demand for
commercial by-products. The soy bean and the combine entered the
Iowa farm scene together.
Since most of the crops grown here are fed locally rather than
sold commercially, live-stock enters the scene as a leading farm activ-
ity. Cattle were at first used as beasts of burden to turn over the
prairie sod. Then followed the general-purpose cattle, the Longhorns,
the Shorthorns, the Angus, the all-purpose stock, and, with the advent
of creameries, dairy stock. '
In hogs, styles have changed from the early razorbacks that fed
on acorns, to the lard, bacon, and combination types, passing through
the periods of the big spotted six-hundred pounders, the small pony
style and the rainbow type. Hybrid hogs are now being produced.
E. C. Forest came from eastern Iowa in 1915 and held widely ad-
vertised sales of Poland China hogs through the years. His son Ed-
ward is now carrying on.
Live stock promotion has met with serious difficulties, such as
the foot and mouth disease which caused country-wide quarantine, and
the T.B. troubl-e now handled with periodic vaccination.
In the midst of the cycle from oxen to tractors, horses were used
extensively. They were shipped out by car loads to eastern markets.
Until 1930, both coach and draft horses were in demand. All this has
changed with the advent of power machinery, until now some farms
have no horses, and others only a single horse or a team.
At one time nearly every farm supported a flock of sheep. In the
early days the wool was shorn, washed, carded, spun and woven dur-
ing the bleak winter, into homespun for clothing for the farm family.
That was the day of the itinerant wool shearers who roamed the
country-side in the spring. Farmers became active in the Wool .Grow-
