The evolution of farm machinery and equipment hasmade these
great records possible. ‘With the pioneers grain was cradled and flail-
ed from straw bound bundles. Next came the reaper with the rake,
the -lV.[arsh_ harvester, the self-hinder, and finally-the threshing ma-
chine, which went through the gamut of-.tread power, horse power,
steam, and tractorpower. For many years the Ink hrothers operated
the only steam powered machine around here, and they threshed as
late as Christmas. The comhine is successful for soy beans in har-
vesting, but straw is still highly valued. _ , - _
Corn fwas first planted by hand andpicked by hand. Later the
field was laid out_with "marker, then the check row; andnow the
four-row power drop-planter with fertilizer attachment is used.
After ‘the hoe, the first cultivator was aplow working along one side
of the row and then the other side. Charles Travis recalls using this
type. Following this was the walking plow which cultivated hoth
sides of the row, then the riding plow, and finally the two-row trac-
tor-drawn plow and the four-row tractor-drawn power lift. Vlfith

E Corn husking contests were once the sport of farm ladsand the
center of a state-wideinterest; but they are now on the wane. .Trac-
tor plnwing contests have replaced thern. We note similarly the
change' from the old fashioned scythe to the horse drawn mower. _'The
tractor-drawn mowers and ralces, the stackers, _field cutters and field
balersplay' their parts in today's haying operations. _ j _
