THE TURN OF THE CENTURY 105
est period of service of any rural mail carrier in Iowa. ln 1907 the
Mount' Vernon post office underwent improvements incident to a
change from third to second class.
]uly 1, 1916 local delivery was started. The town, owing to
the large volume of college mail, was entitled to this service, although
one of the smallest towns which has it. Carl Travis and Lee D.
Evans were the first two carriers. Since that time the regular car-
riers have been Glenn Rogers and the present ones Frank Benesh
and Dana Wilcox. Marguerite Kleinfelter (Mrs. Frank Young)
carried a route during World War I. The inside help who have
served a number of years have been Leon and Otis llfloore, lVIae
Turner l\-Iitchell, Forrest E. Walters, Herbert Rumble, Glenn
Haynes, George Turner, Otis Kepler and the present force, Carl
Travis, Glenn Rogers, Lloyd Kent, and Hobart Bair.
inventors were busy in B/Iount Vernon. In 1902 Mary Whitte-
more received a patent for a ribbon needle to take the place of a bod-
kin. The next year Frank Hann invented a power water blast to be
used in chemical laboratories. The year 1905 saw the completion
of the voting machine designed by E. B. \fVillix, E. L. Keith and W.
A. Smyth. By the next year the Glenn voting machine was tried out
by authorization of _the county supervisors. ‘ ` '
Two well known controversies began. The famous Penn Street
case in which George W. Young, Sr. was defendant and the town the
plaintiff, insisting that Penn Street running 'through the Young
property should be opened, was finally settled in 1904- after three years
litigation. l\/Ir. Young was the victor. ln l903, Cedar Rapids began
her long fight for the county seat which resulted in her victory.
_No chapter in this history is complete without mention of Mount
Vernon’s summer home, the Palisades. ln 1903 _Tames l\/Iinott had
two auction sales of lots, the prices ranging from $20 to $71. l\/Iany
people took advantage of these and built cottages so that two years lat-
er the Pal population numbered one hundred. Who hasnlt been en-
tertained there by the Baumans, the Carsons, the Goughs, or the
Gormlys, or taken a meal at the log-cabin restaurant, general store,
and hotel combined? Or who hasn’t rented a boat- and rowed over
to beautiful Spring Hollow, or up the river to Screeching Sands or
the Blowout? When the Palisades, by the will of Louis Kepler, be-
came a state park it was enlarged and beautihed, but most of the
cottages had to go. It is now a game preserve and recreation area
known as the Palisades-Kepler State Park. To the original bequest
of two hundred acres, the state has added eight hundred. Property
on the west side of the river was bought from the Wolfe and Tom-
linson estates. Glenn’Averill' of Cedar Rapids paid for half of the
one hundred and thirty-eight acres bought from the Tomlinsons in-
cluding the ravines, Spring Hollow and Screeching Sands;
This whole area is of prehistoric and historic interest. A molar
tooth of a mammoth found here speaks of a far distant past,_and Min-
ott’s Rock Shelter and thirteen well-preserved Indian mounds are
