CIVIL WAR DAYS 59
i “Now elbow touches elbow, and ;
rank keeps pace with rank,
And South likes "Yankee_Doodle,"
_ and “Dixie” charms the Yank, _
.And thus as peers, adown the years
We’ll march without a break,
And greet "Old Glory" with our cheers,
_ ~ and Shake, and Shake, and Shake!"
Early in its history, the Grand'Arrny of ‘the _Republic instituted
Memorial Day as an occasion to honor those who served in the Union
army and navy. A veteran, whose nameis, unknown, wrote to Ad-
jutant General North P. Chipman and called attention to the cus-
tom of his native Germany’s people _assembling in springtime to scat-
ter flowers upon- the graves of their dead. :He further urged that
the G.A.R. so honor' its Union dead. ‘Upon receiving this suggestion,
General John. A. Logan, then' Commander-in-chief of the Grand
Army of the Republic, on lVlay 5, 1868 issued the first order setting
aside May 30th as l\/lemorial Day. The first observation of this day
in l\/Iount Vernon is recorded in the l\/Iount Vernon Hawkeye of
June 3, 1870, which tells of a large crowd gathering at Clark and
I~layzlett’s Hall at 3 P.l\/I. to pay its willing tributes of gratitude to
our dead soldiers- The marshall of the day was R. J. Harhert and
the oration at the cemetery was _delivered by   W. Akers. At that

T. W. S. Hale, Charles Coleman, John Q. Wilds, Clark ll/lccoy,
_lohn Archer, Albert Foster, T. L. Smith, _Tohn lde, Levi Mason,
and Vlfilliam Camp.
The fourth annual reunion of the veterans of_Linn County was
held in Mount Vernon on August 29th and 30th, 1838, perhaps the
largest and most successful ever held in the county. A most quiet,
orderly, and well-behaved assembly of soldiers turned the college
campus into a camp. All the business houses and nearly all thc homes
of the town were decorated, many elaborately. From a beautiful arch
on Main Street hung a banner inscribed :---“lrVelcome-»~Our Coun-
try’s Defenders!" “The two drum corps, one from l\/Iarion, the other
from Cedar Rapids, together with our excellent military band, made
things lively in a musical way.” lV[ayor C. W. Kepler in an excellent
address of welcome asserted that the township furnished more volun-
teer soldiers, in proportion to her citizens eligible to military duty,
than any other community in the state. Nlarshall _lames Smith who
was in command was recalled as having had quite an experience in
helping run General l\/Iorgan out of Ohio. At this reunion also Rich-
