Preface
The year 1947 is the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding
of Mount Vernon. To the_ Chamber of Commerce and others, it
seemed fitting that the commemoration take permanent form and that
the facts of our town history be recorded.
Members of the Committee have collaborated on each chapter,
and have carefully edited each one. Many letters have been written,
many calls made, and much research work has been done. The work
of writing the book has of necessity required several months, for the
task has grown as the work progressed. Constantly new material has
been contributed, and the committee has been loathe to conclude the
chapters and write “Finis” to the book lest something important be
omitted. It accordingly thanks all subscribers for their patience.
Memories of the older folk will not always agree, nor are his-
tories and newspapers always correct. Hence some errors may occur
and there inevitably will be omission of some deserving names. The
committee however, has tried to record faithfully all facts reported to
it, and it sincerely hopes that all readers will find the history inter-
esting and that their verdict will be that the efforts of the writers have
not been in vain.
Great credit must be given to S. V. Williams in whose mind the
idea was conceived and whose enthusiasm gave the impetus to the
committee and launched it on its work. To him credit must be given
also for much of the research work and the general plan of the book.
The actual writing of the book has been done by the Committee and
by Mary L. Parsons, Elizabeth B. Ink, and Elmer   Miller. A large
amount of work has also been done by the Business Committee, com-
posed of R. B. Wolfe, Chrm., _lay Fordyce, Secy.-Treas., James Mc-
Cutcheon, and Corlyn Bauman.
Sincere thanks to the older folk for sharing with us their remin-
iscences, to the library staff for their cooperation, to the numerous
individuals who assisted with the typing, to all who loaned their pic-
tutes; to Joseph Bennett and many others who helped with the re-
search work; to Charles Paul for lending his°grandmother’s letters,
and to all who assisted us in any way. '
