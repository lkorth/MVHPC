The Mount Vernon Historic Preservation Commission of the
City of Mount Vernon _has carried on the work of the Bicentennial
Committee in preserving the history of the town. 300 copies of this
reprint and supplement were ordered and sold in 1991 as part ofthe
Commissiorfs continuing effort to make available the_story -of the
unusual community. ` ' _
For several years the Historical Committee of Mt. Vernon
hoped to reprint A CENTENNIAL HISTORY O!" M iff VERNON,
IOWA 1847 - 1947 or write a new book based on fresh int`ormation.
The press of time led the committee to reprint the book with this
supplement. Ou_r hope is to correct some of the known errors in the
book, to tell the story oi" how the book was written in 1947, and to
add some information that will make the Cl:`NTl;`NNI/IL IHSTOR Y
more valuable to readers in 1976. The supplement does not try to
bring Mt. Vernon history up to date as that task requires extended
research. - _ `
This supplement was prepared by Mr. Elmer Miller and Mr.
James MeCutcheon, who worked on the original book, and Dr.
Richard Thomas, Chairman of the History Committee and the
Bicentenniali-Conrrnitteel' - . _
