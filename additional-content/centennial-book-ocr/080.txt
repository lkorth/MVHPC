76 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
ing the progress of these- there occurred the anti-Copperhead scuffle
already referred to in the Civil War chapter.
While Cornell College at the time of the opening of 'the Civil
War- was in need of capable people to man its offices and lead its
students in academic life, there was the equally, if not greater, need
of someone to find and apply funds, for expenses". The financial de-
pression which began in 1857 made the payment even of salaries some-
what in doubt. As acting president, Professor King was required to
add to his classroom duties that of gatheringthese funds. Where to
go for them? President Fellows had always been able_ to find neces-
sary friends in the East, that potent reservoir of _help. What could
Professor King do? The firing upon Fort Sumter had greatly ex-
cited the West, and during the early days of the War three full corn-
panies had been raised in_Mt. Vernon. The required essays and dec-
larnations in the college English program had dealt with war interests,
and many of the enlistees in the companies raised had been Cornell
students. Furthermore, in 1864 the trustees decided to raise a fund
to help disabled soldiers and their -orphans to obtain' a good educa-
tion and the matter was brought to the attention of the adjutant-
general of the state, N. B. Baker. ' P _
_ So Dr. King, armed with a letter from the adjutant-general,
started onthe task of 'collecting “subscriptions” to the funds of the
college from the pay of the soldiers in the field. The aggregate
amount of subscriptions in this first venture was about $30,000; and
of this finally somei$l4,000 was actually collected and placed in the
fund. Out of thisfand later efforts grewthe burden of free and per-
petual scholarships- which later causedthecollege some embarrass-
ment, until they were finally-only in _comparativelyrecent dayse
donated to the college or annulled. '  
'In April 1865 Richmond surrend,ered_ and the War was almost
over. Dr. King returned to Mount Vernon and began to” think of
making it his permanent home. He was made President at the com-
mencement of that year. 'After some financial negotiations and the
help of friends, Dr. King was able to secure possession of thedesirable
crest of the hilltop with its fine mansion. Before winter settled in
regular Iowa fashion the president and his bride, Margaret McKell
of Chillicothe, Ohio, were occupying the White House on the hill.
For eight years the college gradually moved forward under the
skillful guidance of President King. Money was never plentiful; sal-
aries were very low; and sometimes these were available only in prom-
issory notes. lndeed, Professor Freer sometime afterwards pointed
out a house on Main Street (later known as the Grill), which he
had occupied and which he said he bought and paid for from money
received on delayed salary. _ __ _
In mid-summer-of 1874 Dr. King returned _from an extended trip
abroad and _found thatthe trustees of the college had resolved to erect
