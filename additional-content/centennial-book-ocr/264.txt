ERE’S A MAN buried un-
- der U. S. highway No. 30.
plump in the middle of Mt.
Vernon, Iowa.
In 1843, the year after Mt. Ver-
non had been platted, a stranger
named Servison came to the new
village. He hurried on next day,
leaving his elderly and ailing fa-
ther in the care of Mr. and Mrs. H.
D. Metcalf, early settlers.
- Within a few hours, the old man
had died of what was supposed to
be cholera. They buried him in the
night under Mt. Vernon’s “Main
street", now First street, or U. S.
highway 30. The grave lies under
one of America’s busiest trans-
continental highways near the
corner of Second avenue, a major
crossing in the little city. .
This is but one of many anec-
dotes' related in a book that ap-
peared just the other day after
more than-a year of joint-labors by
aneditorial committee. It is "A
Centennial History of Mt. Vernon,
Iowa, 1847-1947". " '
Mt. Virnon has its buried
Spanish treasure (though, na-
turally, no one has ever found
ii). `
John Brown, “God’s angry man."
lived one winter at Springdale,
just south of Mt. Vernon. He
taught the boys of that Quaker vi]-
lage how to transship along the
“underground railway” N e g r o
slaves, whom Brown had brought
irom the south, to Morse, near
Iowa City .... -

The impartial editors of the book
:relate with -gusto the locally fa-
mous ride of “Billie” Conklin who.
in the late Fifties, made the wrong
turn in n springwagon cunning
back to Mt. Vernon from Mechan-
icsville. He turned his horse down
the railroad track west toward
Lisbon.
A westbound freight came along
on the brand new tracks of the
Chicago and North Western rail-
way. When it stopped at Lisbon
for water, the trainmen found
Billie in his wagon seat, unhurt on
the cow-catcher. Later his horse
“Nigger” was found grazing along
the right-of-way near Mechanics-
viile. _
The history, which appeared
Inst week, is just about Mt.
Vef'n0n’s only 'recognition of its
centennial, the 100th anniver-
sary of the completicin of the
first city plat in “the ideal sum-
-mer” of 1847.
