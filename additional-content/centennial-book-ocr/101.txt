urged that these laws be studied by W.C.T.U. groups over the State.
lllrs. Williams and Mrs. Iorns, delegates to the convention, called
a meeting of the \fV.C.T.U. and other interested women to organize
a society to study this subject. Known for the first year as “The Im-
provement Club,” in 1896 it changed its name to Sorosis and became
a literary club, studying Ida Tarbell’s Life of- Lincoln, which was ap-
pearing serially in McClure’s l\/Iagazine. ' _ r l
There issome confusion in the record as to which of the two lm-
provement Clubs deserves the credit for certain civic reforms. The
Villagelrnprovement Association had been organized at the school
house _on September 18, 1893, dividing the town into four sections
with the following leaders: Northwest, Dr. J. Albrook; Southwest,
Professor G. Currne; Northeast, Mrs. C. P. ‘Whittemore and South-
east, lra G. Fairbanks.
' Of the sixty citizens who organized to improve and beautify the
town, a large proportion were women. Mrs. ll-fyron Neff was made
chairman, it-linard Lozier, secretary. There was no treasurer be-
cause there were to be no dues. Success of the undertaking depended
on voluntary co-operation in clean-up drives and various projects
carrie out over a period of years. At times they joined forces with
the Cemetery Association, also headed by _l\/Irs. Neff. Early in _the
spring these women were busy clearing up the cemetery lots long be-
fore they began raking their own lawns. _ '
These good works led a writer in the Hawkeye to the following
acknowledgment in the issue of December 8, 1893; soon after the
last of the three destructive fires of the year: "A number of the
ladies are talking of organizing a Fire_ Department. It was the ladies
who started a movement for a fence around the cemetery, and, if we
mistake not, it was the ladies who started the Village Improvement
Association. lf the ladies should take hold of the movement for a
fire department, we believe we would have one equal to that of any
town of this size in the State. Surely the elective franchise should
be given to the women." This was twenty-five years before the
United States wpassed the amendment giving the right of suffrage to
women.
Although Mrs. Hugh Boyd’s home responsibilities did not leave
ber with enough time for extensive club work or social life, she will
be long remembered by a host of former music pupils for her patrician
beauty, grace and high quality of musicianship. Before her marriage
to Professor Boyd she had taught piano in the Conservatory. After-
warcl, for many years, she taught the boys and girls o_f the town their
scales and pieces, often continuing to give lessons without charge to
talented pupils who could not afford to pay. At her student recitals
not only were “the sisters and the cousins and the aunts" of her pupils
