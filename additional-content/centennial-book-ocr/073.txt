` The _'l890's
The extent to' which our cemetery needed attention is shown by
the following notation: In October, 1391, a beautiful tribute was
paid to Colonel John Quincy Wilds at a G.A.R. meeting. The next
week acitizen wrote to the paper suggesting that a practical way to
show our appreciation of Colon_el Wilds would be for the “Boys in
Blue” to march out to the cemetery and improve his neglected grave.
In 1893 the ladies of the town decided to raise money for the
cemetery. A news notice read as follows: "The ladies of M_ount Ver-
non will serve-dinner and supper in the Odd Fellows’ Hall in the
Wilcox building. The proceeds are to be devoted to the cemetery fund.
We are making every effort to obtain enough- money to purchase suit-
able iron fencing for our cemetery, and we solicit the patronage of
every one interested." - -Later a news note advised that the dinner Was
a perfect success and that the iron fence was assured. Today one may
journey to the cemetery and admire the honest ruggedness of the char-
acter displayed in the workmanship. °
A serious fire destroyed two buildings. on Main Street in I)e»
cember, 1393 and dispossessed a number of firms and tenants. Rood
and Young’s store was among them. A beneficial result of this
fire was a movement to secure town water facilities. Almost every-
one had his private well and pump, and _few were the houses with
running water. A board of water commissioners was formed. Pipes
were laid, wells were sunk in low ground behind the high school knoll,
and a water tower was erected on the east end of the college hill.
Mount Vernon reached its zenith in building expansion inthe
lS90’s. ln 1890 our population was 1259; in 1900 it was 1629.
Twenty new houses went up in one season at a cost of $50,000. Mars-
den Keyes and Charles Davis made the sound of saw and hammer
familiar at this period. Among others they built the Collin House,
the Rood House, and the homes of Stewart Ellison and William
Platner. Charlie Heller was beginning a long career at this time.
By 1893 twelve miles of cement walks had been laid and intersec-
tions had been established.
