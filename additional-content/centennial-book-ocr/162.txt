8 :30 to 5:30 with the exception of "drug store and confectioners” and
“barber shops which were permitted to keep open on Saturday nights.”
Outside lighting was likewise cut down. Cornell College extended
the Christmas vacation to January 8 in order “to save one car load of
coal.” Lodges were requested not to hold meetings and churches
were urged to hold joint meetings. Upon one occasion, when church
services could not be held, the men students of the Mrs. Hattie Miller
house and the girls of the Watso_n house held church services in the
Miller House living-room with a student pastor in charge. Fuel sup-
plies of the local dealers were soon exhausted and prospects for addi-
tional supplies did not look bright, despite promises made by thegov-
ernment which had taken over the railroads in anheroic attempt to
better the situation. On Saturday, _lanuary 12, ’l8, the situation had
become so critical that a mass meeting was held at the City Hall to
discuss how the situation might be met. Despite the extreme weather
a good many people attended the meeting. The result of the discus-
sion was the decision that the use of Wood was the only practical solu-
tion. A committee was appointed at this meeting to make arrange-
ment for the obtaining of wood. The cornmitteewas composed of
I-l. S. Risser, Chas. E. Hedges, both dealers in coal, _lohn l°etty and
Harry Stinger. The following Tuesday these men personally led a
delegation of volunteers to the Plattenherger timber north of town to
chop and saw. The H awkeye declared “Wood choppers are the high-

load of coal arrived for the use of the schools and local dealers received
one car. Though it was most gladly received, the supply was not
enough to alleviate the necessity of people closing up part of their
homes and others moving in with friends or relatives.
Throughout the war the citizens of the town made every effort
to attempt to have life proceed as normally as possible, Vlfirh this idea
in mind-, Cornell College did all possible to provide music, lectures,
and other. events for the good of morale and general well-being. The
l\’Iay Musi-c Festival was continued, though in l9=lS there were three
Concerts rather than five. There was no Artist’s Course in 1917 and
in 1918 no performance of the Messiah was given because of the lack
of rnen’s voices.
Though the war was alwaysparamount in the minds- of the citi-
zens, much local interest was taken in a drive by Cornell College for
$600,000, an- undertaking which was regarded by many as inoppor-
tune. lt exceeded the goal by $150,000. Interest was likewise tak-
en in the letting of a contract for “the seedling mile", one of the first
indications that before many years Iowa would “be out of the mud.”
Gratification was expressed by the retirement of the last of a twenty-
year water bond issue for $9,500.
Residents of the town, along with' the rest of the nation, took
