HISTORY OF_ MOUNT VERNON
years, comes into mi_nd at once. An In 'Memoriam tribute to Dr
Norton, by_Dr. Charles R. Keyes. and Dr; Neil Miner, in the-Iowa
Academy of Science .Journal for- 1945 gives a fine appraisal of Dr
Norton as a teacher, scientist and, human being:
Wi~th_the- passing of Professor Norton at his' home in' Mount
Vernon, Iowa, on iMay 3, 1944, -much the longest teaching car-
eer in the history of, Cornell College came' to. an end; indeed one
wonders whetherhis-‘years of continuous service may not'be a
national record.
Graduated from Cornell College in 1875 before he-was
twenty years old, he wasappointed. instructor in' Latin a_nd Greek
for the- following academic year. Two yearsiof-successful work
inthis post,along.Withfearning'th'e M-asteris degree, advanced
-him to an adjunct professorship of-Latinand Greek, a position
which he held until '-1881. Meanwhile 'he was delving into
geology entirely on his own initiative. President'-William F.
King evidently recognized the fact thatfhe had a _genius on his
faculty, 'for from 1881 -to 1890 he served as-_-professor of Greek
and geology. In 1890 he~became.professor of-geology, a title that
did not become emeritusfutil 1942-when-he was eighty-sixgyears
old;_He did, to.-be sure, accept an -assistant in I-922-in the now
large _'and prosperous department of geology, partly because of a
passing illness, partly because of a desire toconcentrate more
fully on. his favorite-.course in organic evolution -and partlybe-
cau_se of the increasing demandsof research and publication . . '_
Beginning-in 1892" he served as. special assistant on 'the Iowa
Geological' Survey for a period of for-ty years, in charge of
ground-Water studies in Iowa. From 1903-l-913 he served in
this _same capacityas assistant on the U.S. Geological Survey . . .
_His “Elements of Geology", the first edition of which was pub-
lished in 1905, forthe simple reasonsof its integrity and origin-
ality has remained .for forty yearsa favorite text for beginners
in earth science. ' ' ‘
It was as a teacher, probably-that Dr. Norton- liked best to
be known- . . . The result, of course, was the respect, admira-
tion and love of a host of students, many of these later to win
distinction in their own right _ . . _ . . he cultivated through
thesyears, the fields of art and music and, to -have a home out-of-
doors. interest, he started a large garden of -tulips, iris and peonies..
Especially after his marriage to Mary-Burr in 1883, a woman- of
like mind and. training, a -graduate of Cornell in 1877 and an
instructor and later professor of mathematics. for a period of
forty-two years,_ these- -non-professional studies were pursued
with ,steady interest and some very tangible re_sults . . . In addi-
ti_on to more than a century of teachingfbetween -them, the Nor-
tons are among Corne_llfs.chief _benefactors in a material sense.-
