Our Public Schools
Schools of Pionener Days, 1840-1867
Some of us Mount Vernonites may like to think of the first
schoolhouse in our little settlement on the hill as a log cabin equipped
with home-made benches and puncheons. It might have been. An ac~
count of our school, published in the Mount Vernon Hawkeye-Record,
September 15, 1927, states that there was such a school and locates
it at 4-16 South Second Street, West, or what is now the former home
of Mrs. Clara Brackett Spear.
The History of Linn County (1878), however, states that the
first education in our town was in private homes with teachers paid
by subscription. Such a school was held in the home of ]. T. Rice,
a newspaper man. This house still stands on 417 First Avenue, South.
In charge of this little group of pupils was Miss Fidelia Sweetland,
the first on the list of the public school teachers of Mount Vernon.
The same history states that the first schoolhouse in town was a
frame building, built in 1852, which has been definitely located on
the property belonging to Mrs. Alice Chamberlain Patrick. Mrs.
John ]. Smyth, Whose sister, Arvilla, attended this school, describes
it as a little one-story frame building. It was a district school, made
so by an act ,“to-establish a system of common schools, approved by
the Council and House of Representatives of Iowa, January 16,
184-O.” The firstteacher was Mr. L. W. Mason. -
We find, though, that the three R’s were not entirely confined
to this building. Mrs. Smyth says that Laura Spear taught pupils in
a room above the store now owned by_Dale Johnson, and Miss Mary
Witter taught in a house two doors south of Dick Busenharlds grocery
on First Avenue. '
The First Brick Schoolhouse of 1867
_Just how long school was held in the frame schoolhouse of 1852
we do not know, but eventually the district of Mount Vernon pur-
chased the old Methodist Church. This was located where the high
school stands today. The audience room of the church was divided
into rooms -for school purposes, and school was held in this building
until 1867, At that time the school board made a contract with Wil-
liam Bracltett to erect a schoolhouse on this church lot. The orig-
inal cost of the building was $70l}0, but by the time it had "been
