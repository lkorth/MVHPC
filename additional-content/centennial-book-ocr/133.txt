The New High- School Building _ `
Let us: taltea glance in1 retrospect before we leave. the old high
school building; whiehhad' served' for sixty years in_the process of ed-
ucating _lfunior Mount Vernon-.'but_-which' apparently had. never been
_lookediuponwitli pride. _
In 1891 Editor. S. H12 Bauman. did hisibest to quash the first
addition _on the ground' t-hat the building waseompletelyuout of date'
and had. no. architectural: beauty. N_otwithst_a'nding, the vote for' the
addition carried. ln: 19.03 the Hawkeye made this comment.: “With
the school. staff organized on. a~ moderate and' adequate basis the next
move should be for a good high school- building. Mount Vernon
would then- be able without blushingto' acknowledge that it had a
good. school* system.” Through' the years boys and girls scolded.
and grumbled’ about the “A-rl-t" (as they called .the schoolhouse), and
while they fretted away! the old curfew patiently continued to_ re-
mind; them- every night that it was nine o'clocl{.Q `
In 1911 -the fire hell peeled' out it_S_ excited alarm. “The school-
house. is on firel" people shouted. A little later came the reportthat
the furnace- had- pu-ffedrout some smoke in the basement." On a Satur-
day morning a few weeks later the fire._bell_1fang again, _and _boys
rushed to the- schoolhouse. A spark from the furnace had blackened
some of the basement steps. - . _ _ '_   _ _
Theboys and girls were ruthless' inf their disdain. for the school-
house of their fathers. 'They wished itwould burn clown, but the old
high-towcred building stood staunch-' on the hilltop. ' - ._
_ The year 1926 is memorable in the history of our schools because
Mount Vernon votedifor its new high' school building. 'lt came about
this way: Physical training was a state requirement now. Mount
Vernon either had to' build a gymnasium. or a high school building
with a gymnasium; On April 8, the town voted aga-inst.a gymnasium.
On April 28, the question of a schoolhouse 1a-I: a cost of' $115,000 was
placed 'before the people. Exci-ternent ran high. From noon until
eight o’clock car after car loaded with voters--whose faces registered
_happy anticipation or. firm opposition droye up to the_city _hal‘l-. Seven
hundred sifxty-five -ballots' were east. Four hundred fourteen were
-forlthe new building; three hundred fifty-one were against _it.
n 'Members of the schoolboard upon whom fell the task of directing
the building program' were: Thomas' Rogers-, president, Dr. Kate
Mason I-Iogle, Harry Gilliland, John' Klimo, and R.   Patten.
