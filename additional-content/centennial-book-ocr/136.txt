Organizations of the Town
Organizations have enriched the life of our community from the
beginning. The Social bonds and enlivening fellowships of the great
national organizations made their presence felt early in town life.
Later, the awakening eagerness of intellectual and musical de-
velopment made itself manifest in the organization of literary and
musical societies, especially before and after the turn of the century.
Their sociallfellowship gradually replaced the formal entertaining
of large groups of friends in individual homes.
As the needs of a complex social and national organization were
more deeply felt, there arose the service organizations which fostered
the development of acquaintance and high ethical standards in busi-
ness and in national and international life. '
The organizations of our city, in the order of class and date of
