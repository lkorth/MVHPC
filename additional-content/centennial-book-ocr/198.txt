knitting one hundred pieces, thoughbeiore the war ended she had
finished more than two hundred, many of them the largest and heav-
i_est sweaters called Ifor. '_ ~'
In October 1942 thousands of people of the town and country
side had their first view of one of the powerful new instruments of
war, which our boys were being trained 'to operate, when a Boeing
B-17 on routine mission out of Topeka, Kansasmade an emergency
landing on a Fred Sargent :farm north of town. Weather and
engine trouble kept the big plane grounded for twelve days andior
the time of its stay all roads seemed to lead to the Sargent bean field.
The local Civilian Air Patrol gave interested assistance to the crew
and some members of the C.A.P. were privileged to ride in the Flying
Fortress after it was made ready to return to the base. The best of
Iowa hospitality was offered to the stranded crew and homes where
they were entertained were saddened later to hear that two of them
had been killed in action. As a result oi this visit from the skies ladies
Bernice Gill of Mount Vernon was married the following year to Sgt.
J. C. Farrell of-Washington, lf).C., top gunner on “The Floozy."_
Since Cornell College is inseparably a part of Mount Vernon,
war measures atthecollege were reflected in the life of the town.
Just as the young and active men -were being drawn out oi the town,
so the college quickly lost its vigorous men students. Negotiations
were begun to make the collegea part of the base training program
for the armed services. Plans begun by President J. B. :Magee were
completed after his death by 'President R. D. Cole with the able as-
sistancein Washington of Col. William C. Rigby, an alumnus of
the college and a~'former resident of Mount Vernon, and Leo Paulger
of the Federal Reserve Bank, a trustee and alumnus oi the college.
The college was to receive a unit oi 600 men- tobe called the Naval
Flight Preparatory School at Cornell College. -
As its' part of the contract the college loaned eight men from
its instructional staff and the use of Merner, Rood, Altoona, Guild,
Bowman ,the conservatory practice house, classrooms in Main and
Law buildings and partial use of' the gymnasium. One of _the com-
ically common sights of those exciting days was the moving opera-
tions of the' girls as they tried to compress their belongings into half
or less the space they had used before.
With the arrival of the first group of 200 men, the Navy took
over. Names of the buildings were changed to names of ships and
nautical terms-decks, bulkheads, shore leave-became accepted
speech; squads of vigorous young men were routed .out at early dawn
to be marched to the rhythmical “Hup, two three, four” to chow,
Bowman Hall or “The Wasp” and to an incredible number of classes.
All this activity crowded to capacitythe facilities of the campus with
'an enrollment in college of about five hundredstudents. _ _
