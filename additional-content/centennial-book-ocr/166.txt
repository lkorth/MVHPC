146 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
not a speculator, they said: "Not one foot of land for speculation;
but thousands for settlement and cultivation.” A
The record of those centennial and near-centennial farms is as-
tonishing. On the land entered from the government by Jeremiah
Burge in 1839 a fifth generation now lives, Vernon Burge of the
fourth generation is farming extensively with power machinery along
with his father, Harold Burge. George Burge, a grandson of Jere-
miah, took prizes at international live-stock shows. His enthusiasm
for all kinds of pure-bred stock earned for him an instructorshipin
the Oregon Agricultural College. He had shorthorn cattle, Shropshire
sheep, Poland-Chinahogs, Wyandotte chickens, Percheron horses, and
he created community interest in better farming. Today on this same
land at old “St. Mary’s Crossroads,” the Milo Wolrabs are win-
ning honors in all these parts with their Berkshire hogs.
Henry Kepler, 1839, became county superintendent and school
director. The three brothers, Henry, Conrad, and Peter, all entered
land from the government. Morton Kepler is still farming at the old
place, with a hundred year plaque on the front doorway. Descendants
of these' brothers 'have become doctors, lawyers, merchants, farmers,
and postmaster.
Samuel Ellison in 1840 staked out land north of town. His
grandsons, Harveyand Irvin, and great-grandson Harlan, still farrn
in that part, the latter growing turkeys extensively.
Chauncey Neal came here in 1839 with twenty-five cents in his
pocket. His grandson, Burt Neal,_experimented with line breeding
of Shorthorns. He pioneered with his brother Ben (named a lV[aster
Farmer in 1939) in improved seed-corn production as far back as
1904. The great-grandchildren of Chauncey located on farms in this
area are Gordon, Howard, Benny, l\/Iyron, Mrs. Adolf Biderman
and Mrs. Austin Armstrong.
Henry C. Platner, 1840, was a farmer and stock raiser but served
also as township trustee and school director.- A great-grandson, Ar-
thur, farms the land entered by George Yeisley in 1839. John Wolfe
in 1840 operated a ferry over the Cedar River at Ivanhoe; and the
original farm is still in possession of his grandson Dr. Thomas Wolfe,
grand-daughter Grace, and great-grandsons Richard and Dan.
John Hoffman came in a prairie schooner in 1846 and entered
160 acres from the' government. This has now expanded to 367 acres.
Brothers Ben and C. H. Hoover descendants, came in 1847, and their
descendants are still to be found here. Foster and John B. Leigh
came in 1851 and entered a large tract of land, but they had to sign
a note to get 25 Cents for an express package at the depot!
