John Benjamin Nlagee, eighth president of Cornell, died April
6, 1943, after less than four years in office. He came to the presi-
dency frorn the pastorate' of the First Methodist Church in Seattle,
honored as one of the ten outstanding preachersin Methodism and a
writer of distinction. In his funeral sermon John Magee jr. said
of his father, “He was a man of great fairness and justice. He was a
man of gentleness and peace.” During his brief administration he es-
tablished the student health clinic, created Founde1"s and Builder’s
Day, promoted the addition to Pfeiffer Hall and took a leading part
in negotiations with the navy which led to Cornell’s being chosen as
a U.S. Naval Flight Preparatory School. Citizens of l\’Iount Ver-

married Women students. Later, as the service men returned, many
of them with Wives and babies, the housing situation in town became
acute so that barracks had to be built for married couples as well as
for unmarried service men. In order to give more G.I.’s the oppor-
tunity for education in a liberal arts college, the ceiling of six hun-
dred students was raised for the duration of the emergency.
In his report to the Trustees for the year 1942-’4-3, President
Cole stated that at the beginning of the ninth decade of its history,
