36 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
' Surrounding the chureh and the parsonage was an iron fence
which curved 'gracefully to the front door. Against this fence the lads
of the day liked to lean while waiting for their girl friends to 'come
out of Epworth League. Overlooking it was the grand sixty-foot
tower in which the b_irds found a homeelose to the sanctuary. _ The
story goes that this tower was the ‘target for the rifle of Bert 'Chub-
buclc whose home was _the present parish house and from it George
Young, jr., once shot a hawk. ` J
Many are the cherished memories of the Old Brick church and
congregation: the eloquent early pastor who often :emphasized the
high points of 'his sermon by jumping over the 'altar rail, Howard
Kepler ushering in the center aisle, Mrs. H. G. l\/filler-’s and Mrs-.
H. O. Pratt’s 'beautiful paisley shawls, the shouting 'at the revival
meetings, the organ concerts of “Blind” Boone, and Lew Lozier,
from his vantage post in the choir, drawing clever caricatures of mem-
bers of the congregation. ' I
Music is ever an _'essential part of worship, and one cannot ade-
Iquately measure the effects of the good old hymns of the church.
l\/Iernoriesof the `choir.as it 'rendered the Weekly anthem are retained
with much appreciation. _One recalls 'the 'names of Professors Van-
Valitenburg, Mather and Barbour, 'as directors of the choir and the
faithful organists pumping _the old .organ tirelessly: Horace Alden
Miller, the Misses Clara Brackett, Agnes Randall, Carrie Keyes,
and others. Singers. oflocal note_ were there: the Kepler girls-
Birdie and Hattie; Myrtle Young, Stella ~Hogle,____Mrs. Edith 'Cum-
rnings, John C. Wade, Joseph Bennett," J. M. Tallnlan, Minard,
Horace and Lew Lozier, an_d John Trowbridge, who resigned to
teach music at the Moody Bible Institute. Gone, -though many are
to the Choir Immortal, their songs still linger in our hearts. J
Animpressive list of devout pastors, faithful superintendents,
andfworkers mark the 187O’s. They' were: Rod-trick Norton, father
of Dr. Wm.   Norton; E. W. Jeffries, Julius Stevens, T; C. Gold-
en, R. W. Peebles, and the beloved R. D. Parsons, pastor from 1376
to 1879, 'who elected upon-retirement to spend _his last days in Mount
Vernon. ~' ~ - _
_ Following these were: W. H. Smith,     Rhea, T. B. Cher-
rington, S. W. Heald, R. F. `Hurlburt and H.'O. Pratt. Cherring-
ton was deeply evangelistic; 'I-Ieald was a conference secretary for
many years; Pratt had been a member of Congress and was converted
while still in Washington, -D.C., and finally came Homer C. Stuntz,
just home from the mission field, anddestined-to inspire-the -building

men. . -
