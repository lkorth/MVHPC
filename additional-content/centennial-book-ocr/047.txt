FAMILY LETTERS 4-3
Henry A. Collin arrived here Monday. Dr. Carhart arrived
here over two weeks ago, but his goods haven’t come. Your box hasn’t
come yet and I am feeling uneasy about it. _ Benjamin has written to
Rock Island, but has not had an answer. He wants to thresh his grain
beforehe goes to the' river. When Dennison came, Mother Ford,
sent a vest pattern of black brocade satin for Benjamin, abeautiful
collar and a gingham apron for ine. Jarnes Ford Sent Ann Alida and
Mary each a McGuffey primer. They are very much pleased with
them; Ann Alida already reads and Mary knows her A B C’s. 'Also
Mother and Father Ford sent the girls each a little rocking chair
and they have already received Fanny and Rebecca’s dressed dolls. I
wish you could see how happy they are with them as they rockthem
in their little chairs. Henry A. Collin arrived here Monday. He is
Father Ford’s cousin. He has been all through Illinois and n_ortheast-
ern Iowa. He and two other menewere out on the prairie four days,
slept in their wagon, and shot game. 'He said that he bought tea and
crackers and other foodin Dubuque 'and when he left he hired a
wagon and “left for the wilderness,” and at' times were forty miles
from any habitation. I-Ie likes it here as well as any place he has seen,
and thinks of buying here so as to havebenefit of the schools. Father,
if you will sell and come here, you can buy' a scholarship for $60.00
and send one of the children at a time as long as this institution lasts
-and each one of the family can receive a good education.

I don't believe I have written you how different the holidays
are here than at home. Christmas is more like the Fourth of July;
they fire off guns and anvils and at night send up fire balls. " People
don't spend Christmas here as they do in New York; -instead of
“Merry Christmas” and “Happy New Year” their greeting is
“Christmas "gift," and “New Year's gift”; and you 'don't see any hot
toddy or liquor of any kind,” which I think is a fine change.. We at-
tended an oyster supper at Mr. Carnp’s; there was also one at Mc-
Kane’s. We had a temperance lectureat the church by Mr. St.-John
of Delhi. Before the lecture started the house was crowded and they
could not all be seated. He had them either laughing or in tears.
The next night he lectured at Church Town (Lisbon). _ Mr. Collin
went hunting yesterday and brought in a nice mess-of quail; just dress-
ed the breasts of the fowl and threw the rest away. He brought a
shot gun with him, leaving his rifle and a large trunk in Chicago,-
only bringing a satchel with him.
.....i-.-.i-
We have all been down withchills and fever. _ I was so terribly
sick that I thought I never would live' through it. My things' were
destroyed more by hired help than all the time that I’ve kept house.
Our girl- went home Monday, saying that she would he back the next
