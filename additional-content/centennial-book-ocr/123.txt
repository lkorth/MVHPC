OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS 109
Here are some recollections of very early school days in Mount
Vernon. Mrs. Edith Waln Cumming of Alhambra, California, re-
calls that in her time there was no graduation. The-girls wore very
long dresses to school. One of her favorites had eleven ruffles on
it. As she phrased it, “The skirts of those days were capable of hold-
ing more ruffles than they are now.”
' Mrs. Augusta Minott, who was in the higher department in
1879, says that those who had completed their course gave an es-
say before the class and were given a certificate. Mrs. Minott's
dress for the last day was madeof white knickerbocker cloth. It was
very long and made ggvith a polonaise, a Waist and draped overskirt
Worn over a separate skirt.
Mrs. Minott remembers the fun the pupils used to have coasting
down the hill toward the cemetery. The hill on which the school-
housestands has been graded so much the acclivity, even though it
seems steep to us today, is slight compared with what it was in the
early days at Mount Vernon. In the spring the horses tugged away
to pull the wagons through the mud; in the summer the coats of the
animals were lathered with sweat before they got to the top. There
was a blacksmith shop at the foot of that hill. It was called Hard-
scrabble Hill by the early settlers.
One morning l\{rs. l\fIinott chanced to glance out of the east
window of the high roorn. She saw a covered wagon coming down
the hill from the cemetery. She became so interested that, ignoring
the strict discipline of her teacher, Mr. ]. C. Johnson, she rose up
in her seat for a better look. She saw not only one prairie schooner
but three. The horses were pulling their heavy load up Hard-scrabble
Hill. Children were peeking out of every available opening in the
canvas. Horses, cattle, and dogs were following the covered wagons.
“What did your teacher do to you for looking out of the Win-
dow ?” she was asked. _
‘He made me go out in the cold and stand on the stile While the
caravan passed”. Mrs. lVIinott continued, “I’ll never forget how I
hated to go back into that school room. I Wanted to go home, but
I did not dare.” -
Rapid Expansion in the 1880's 1 '
Nluch more was stirring educationally between 1330 and 1890
than in the previous decade. Vocational subjects were in the offing.
An editorial in the_Hnwkfiye in June, 1831, was called “Educate the
Hand, Too.” It stated, "The idea of public schools that will turn
out trained hands asfvvell as trained heads is rapidly growing more
dominant among the people Who pay for our public schools.” A
later comment in the paper referred to home economics in this fashion:
