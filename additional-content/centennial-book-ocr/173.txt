Following the able pastorates of the Reverend Alexander K.
Baird, 1883 to 1890, and the Reverend Edmund S. Brownee, 1891 to
1894, there came a man who was to fulfill the most useful and note-
worthy pastorate in the history of the local Church. The Reverend
Andrew K. Knox was pastor from 1894 to 1906, the longest pastorate
of the town. He was a popular preacher, and a hardworking en-
thusiastic pastor. The attendance soon outgrew the little wooden
building near the end of Main Street. In 1395, despite the panic of
’93, $5,000 was raised and work on a new. church was begun. The
completed structure cost more than $10,000 and was dedicated on
Sunday, Nlarch 1, 1896, free of debt. The building committee was
Dr. James Carson,-John B.`_Leigh, D. L_- Boyd, M. L. Ink, W. H.
Goudy, Joseph' Bair, and Wm. McFarland. Trustees were Dr. T.
A. Gormly, john E. Kyle, D. W.'Ford, L. H. Odell and james Kirk-
patrick. Rulingelders were Robert Smyth, D. L. Boyd, W. H.
Goudy, Wm. l\fIcFarland, W. E. Platner and J. S. Cowan.
The church is well situated on the top of the hill on the north-
west corner of Main Street and Third Avenue. The lower stone
came from the local quarry, Wm. Platner, the manager and elder in
the Ci'1urch,'giving generous terms. The architecture, with rounded
arches and horizontal lines, may be characterized as having a Roman-
esque feature. The auditorium is 70 feet long by 4-5 feet Wide, with
entrance on the south and pulpit in the northern end, with a large
gallery in therear. There 'are _commodious church parlors below
and above a pipe-organ, a gift in,19ll of Frank Armstrong, a former
Mount Vernon boy and member of this church. john H. Leigh left
$8,000 for an organ maintenance fund. and this, with other gifts, was
invested in a large farm which brings in a goodly annual income for
thatworthy purpose. l\-Irs. l\»1. B. Vlfaln left $1,000 for a flower
fund in honor of her husband Milton B. `Waln, and others have given
similar generous -legacies through the years.
The corner stone ofthe church was laid, September 5, 1895.
The dedicatory services, March 1, 1396, were conducted most ef-
fectively by Dr. W. G. Craig, Professor of Theology, _in the Mc-
Cormick Seminary of Chicago. At the evening service, three prom-
inent Methodists expressed their good will. They were Pres. Wm.
F. King, Dr. Thomas Nicholson, and the Reverend H. O. Pratt.
