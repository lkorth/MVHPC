' The Seminary grew so fast that a new building soon became im-
perative. On July 4-th, 1856 the cornerstone of Main Hall was laid
to the accompaniment of a local band consisting of ]ohn C. Foster
bugler, and E. S. Bargelt beating a drum made from stovepipe iron
and calfskin. Principal Fellows gave such an earnest, heartfelt address
that Matthew Cavanaugh, of the first graduating class wrote fifty
years later, _“I was spellbound at his address, It was like Lincoln’s
address which founded the Republican party. Reporters forgot their
notebooks.” The building was completed and dedicated" in December
1857, Bishop Clark giving the address. After almost a hundred years

Harriette Cooke, was secured to fill her place, and remained with the
college until 1890, becoming the first full time woman professor west
of the Mississippi. Cornellians through those years recall with deep
appreciation her able, scholarly teaching in many branches, and her
inspiring Christian leadership. It was said that she courted sleep
by conjugating Greek verbs. Two tall cottonwood trees in front of
the chapel were her planting. The college honored her in l94-4 as
one of the “Founders” of Cornell.
