ln _Iune 1869, a vote was taken at the school house resulting in
125 votes for incorporation and 18 against. The county clerk issued
an order for incorporation and the election of officers. On August
20th the-following men were elected on a “full ticket of prohibition
temperance": Mayor, L. L. Pease; trustees, W. -H. Goudy, W. B.
Armstrong, Dr. J. Doron, D. C. Sawyer, Isaac Wilcox; recorder,
S. H. Bauman.
Our new council kept busy. People were clamoring for side-
walks, water courses, and crossings. Preceding the incorporation
there was only an occasional board walk in the town. The council
requested at once that board sidewalks be built on Main Street. Sim-
ultaneously it was~ confronted with a petition for sidewalks on Jeffer-
son and Washington streets leading to the depot. One petition fol-
lowed another. By November of 1869 we find our editor making
this comment, "'- _
“Thesalary of our mayor is $0.00 with pickings and abuse-
while the salary of our councilman is $000.00 with circus tickets and
abuse-and the recorderis salaryis $00,000.00 and abuses.” ~
