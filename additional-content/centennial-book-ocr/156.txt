136 HISTORY OF MOUNT VERNON
numerous students. The women of the college made hundreds of
sand bags.
Provision was made for the women of the college to take classes
in first aid and Red Cross work. ' Forty women were instructed in
the Red Cross work by Miss Belle McKnight, a graduate Red Cross
nurse of Dubuque. Mrs. Cordia Bauman conducted a class in the
preparation of surgical dressings. Two hundred and fifty girls
signed up for the class in first aid. This class was under the direction
of local physicians who offered their services. The first lecture was
given by Dr. A. Crawford the same day that military drill was begun.
Pres. Flint immediately offered the college campus for a Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps to H. O. SQ Heistand, Adjutant General in
Washington. A letter was promptly received thanking him for his
offer which had been filed for consideration.
The intensity of patriotic feeling ran high in the early days of
the war and soon there was a widespread movement on foot to or-
ganize a volunteer student army. Before the end of the month, Dr.
Wm. I-I. Norton, representative of the local student body, had receiv-
ed a reply to his letter from Congressman Good, who opposed the plan.
Careful study prompted him to vote against the idea as he had found
that the public in general favored selective service.
A number of college students had left college for officers’ train-
ing at Fort Snelling. Among them were a number of seniors. These
men were awarded their degrees at Minneapolis at a special convo-
cation service shortly after commencement. Two local' men, Clyde
Thompson and Chester Roe Howard, were among them. The fol-
lowing summer Dr. Flint went to Camp Colt at Gettysburg to award
degrees to a number of students, none of whom were from Mount
Vernon. -
In the fall of 1917 the outlook for military drill on the campus
was uncertain as there were no officers available. Pres. Flint, how-
ever, was able to secure the services of Lt. W. N. MacQueen, a Can-
adian soldier on leave while eonvalescing from wounds received at
the front. Robert A. Falconer, President of the University of Tor-
onto, was instrumental in making the arrangements. On September
28, the officer, who had in the meantime become a captain, arrived to
take over his duties. Capt. Norman MacQueen proved to be efficient
in his work and was much sought after as a public speaker because of
his knowledge of military affairs and his experiences at the front. Be-
cause of the shortages of officers, arrangements were later made
whereby Capt. MacQueen spent portions of three days weekly at Coe
College. I-le was popular with both students and townspeople and
remained for the entire school year. He returned to Mount Vernon
in the latter part of December l9l8, at which time he married Miss
Florence Baldwin, a graduate of M.V.H.S. and Cornell, 1919.
