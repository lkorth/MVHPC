THE FOUNDING OF CORNELL COLLEGE 29
ground was broken for the new building, which was 40 by 72 feet,
our present “Old Sem.” Richard Harbert and Henry Albright were
the carpenters and masons. Everyone who could spareithe time for
labor, willingly donated it. Boys in their teens, in straw hats and
barefooted, hauled sand from the Cedar River and carried hods for
the masons. Bowman was both college agent and pastor for that
year and then he resigned the pastorate, devoting his time for 'five
years to financing the new institution and leaving it with an endow-
ment of $100,000. He personally superintended the work of build-
ing, hiring, and paying the laborers.
On horseback Elder Bowman traveled as far as Mount Morris,
Illinois, to persuade Rev. S. M. Fellows to accept the principalship of
the Seminary. Fellows brought with him Prof. David Wheeler, a
competent teacher and silver-tongued orator, who taught both science
and language. Wheeler had deep temperance convictions, and when
a crowd broke into a saloon-to-be and brought out whiskey barrels,
Wheeler gave a stirring address to justify the deed while the whiskey
ran down the gutter. He became later a consul in' Genoa, Italy, and
then president of Allegheny College. Miss Catherine Fortner' was
the able preceptress and in the absence of both Wheeler and Fellows,
opened the school in the brick church on east Main Street. With the
help of F. L. Knott, Principal Samuel Fellows taught ethics and re-
ligion, Miss Olive Fellows was the teacher of instrumental music
and Miss Sarah Matson was a general assistant. The first catalogue
was issued in 1854 and contained sixteen pages.
In the fall of 1853, six men went down deep into their reserves
to put the struggling institution on its feet. They were: Henry Al-
bright, -E. D. Waln, Jesse Holman, William Hayzlett, Henry Kepler
and Allison Willits. Eliiah Sells of Bloomington (Muscatine) gave
$200 worth of crockery which Bowman. promptly turned into cash.
Others gave heifers, pigs, cows, potatoes, and produce. Bowman tried
to persuade A. J. Kynett to give his _gold watch, but Mr. Kynett f_irm-
ly insisted that he needed it to start church services in the absence
of clocks. '_
November 14, 1853 witnessed a strange parade as Principal
Fellows with his corps of teachers followed by 57 girls and 104 boys
marched enthusiastically up Main Street, while townspeople flocked
to thedoors and windows for the epoch-making event. On they went
up the hill to the unfinished building, where only the' partitions had
been plastered, but where nevertheless they began regular classes.
The chapel and recitation hall were on the main floor, the ladies’
dormitory on the second floor, and the men’s dormitory on the third
floor. Kitchen and 'dining hall were in the rear' of the building.
The trials and victories of those early days are well described in
the novel by Miss Marjorie Meda1']r,."1'n Old Crirzoline Days." There
