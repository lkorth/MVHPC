and _First Avenue as a work-shop. Women of the town immediarely
cleaned the building and other preparations followed. Four sewing
machines were furnished bygenerous citizens. Miss Nettie Fairbanks
served as chairman of the project; Mrs. Armstrong Spear, Vice-
chairman ;and Mrs. Cordia Bauman took charge of surgical dressings.
Three more machines were obtained from Mrs. Earl Mitchell and the
Mount Vernon High School. The Wapsie Power and Light Com-
pany provided a. small portable electric machine and Harry Gilliland
furnished a motor. The work-shop could accommodate -fourteen
women. They brought various kinds of. food which they shared-with
each other. These “pot-luck” lunches made it possible for the women
to Work longer hours. Within five months of the formation of the
chapter a report showed that “more than $3,500 has been raised in
cash.” Nlembership in the Red Cross soon passed the six hundred
mark. With great rapidity the women turned out themuch-needed
articles. Women' of all ages knitted for the Red Cross and added
their handiwork to the other finished articles. 'Women carried their
knitting to lectures, clubs, concerts andother gatherings. College
girls found time to add a 'row or two of stitches between class periods.
Everyone knitted. On one occasion needles clicked during the morn-
ing services of the Niethodist Church. Such enthusiasm was not look-
ed upon with much favor and the procedure was not repeated.
Contributions for the local chapter' came from various sources.
'On _lune 22, '17, the Gamboliers, a local theatrical group, gave a
benefit performance of “Pygmalion and Galatea.” ln August of the
same year the Hila Morgan Stock Co., while on its annual weekly
visit, announced that 25% of the proceeds from “The Girl Back
Home” would be contributed. Threatening weather prompted light
attendance and the contribution was limited to $25.00. During the
same month, the Rebekah Lodge sold ice cream on the lawn of the
Dr. Thos. L. Wolfe residence on lt/Iain Street and contributed the
profit to the organization. In November a drive for two thousand
dollars exceeded its goal by two dollars by a seven dollar contribu-
tion made by a stranger, later identified as Nick Doffing, a travel-
ing salesman of Exira, Iowa. On February 14, '18, a group of young
people of 'Lisbon presented “The l\dan from New York" at the College
Chapel. The performance not only provided an evening of good en-
tertainment, but swelled the treasury by $160.00 A few Weeks later
Miss Rose Evelyn Baker of the Cornell faculty and always popular
with Mount Vernon audiences, gave an evening of dramatic readings
at the College Chapel. A box social under the general auspices of the
l.0.0.F. Lodge was he1d_in its hall over the Bauman Clothing Co.
The event proved enjoyable and profitable for the Red Cross. The
boxes brought $70. Entertainmentwas provided by a Cedar Rapids
orchestra. The main feature of the evening was theauctioning off of
