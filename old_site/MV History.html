			Design review is a process to guide property owners in the proper maintenance and enhancement of their structures and neighborhoods through design review guidelines which are promoted and published by the Commission. All property owners in historic districts must apply for one of the following certificates before making any changes in appearance to their property.<br>
			A Certificate of No Material Effect is applied for when a property owner, requesting a building permit, demonstrates that there will be no change in the exterior appearance of their building or site which will affect the historic character of the district.<br>
			A Certificate of Appropriateness is applied for when a property owner requesting a building permit or demolition permit demonstrates that any alterations are in keeping with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, or that the improvements will not alter or will improve the property's historic appearance.<br>
