			<h1><font face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times">Prices</font></h1>
			<p>Prices will vary from photo to photo depending on the amount of time needed to complete a project. To receive an estimate I must see the photo in person. You can mail me the photo or you can email me a low res. scan of the photo. No single photo restoration fee will be more than $30.00.<br>
			</p>
			<p>Prints are sent to Linn Photo for professional printing and picked up and checked by me before sending them back to you. For sizes up to 4x6 the price is $1.00/print a 5x7 costs $2.50, and an 8x10 costs $6.50. This does not include restoration services! <br>
