		</div>
		<p>&middot; Age:1859<br>
		</p>
		<p>&middot; Brick Pattern: English Garden Wall<br>
		</p>
		<p>&middot; Architectural Style: Some Colonial style traits, eg. Centrally located door. Cornerstone located in the left hand corner of the second story.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Historical Significance: The building was built by the New School faction of the Presbyterians in 1859 after a split with the Covenanter branch who were strict abolitionists and would not allow the moderate New Schoolers to use their church. They resolved their quarrel and the church was never used for its original purpose. It is now an apartment house.</p>
