			<p>Take a walk through Mount Vernon, Iowa, and you'll see why it is unique among midwestern towns. Built on and around a long, rolling hill, it is home to one of the most attractive college campuses in the U.S. - <a href="Cornell%20Dostrict.html">Cornell College</a>.</p>
			<p>Mount Vernon's carefully tended Victorian-era homes and quaint business district recall an era of days gone by. This web site will help you become familiar with the architectural expressions of four distinct eras, which have shaped Mount Vernon's growth. Each era contributed to the town's prosperity, leaving its mark on local culture and the appearance of Mount Vernon today.</p>
