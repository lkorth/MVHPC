		<p>           Mount Vernon owes its existence to Iowa's first state road and to its topography. A furrow dug with a plow and oxen from Iowa City to Dubuque initially marked Highway 1. Lyman Dillon was awarded a contract from a Congressional appropriation of 1840 to create the trail of 100 miles. The trail had been laid-out by Army Engineers. They called it Military Road because it was to mark the way for troops to come from Dubuque to protect the territorial capital in Iowa City, as there were a number of Indians to the west of Iowa City. Where the Military Road crossed the crest of the hill or &quot;paha,&quot; businesses developed. When travelers reached the top, they would certainly want to stop, water horses or oxen, and take a break before going down the hill towards Anamosa or Iowa City. Highway 1, the first highway in the state of Iowa, was the first major north-south link in the state. Because of this, almost all of the traffic going toward the state capital had to go both up and down this hill regardless of the direction of travel. Remember, Dubuque was the largest town in the territory and the early population was on this eastern edge.<br>

		<p>          The Black Hawk War of 1832 resulted in the land in this area being taken from the Sac and Fox tribes, and Mount Vernon's first residents began settling here soon after. The farmers took the flat lands and the lower lands. William Abbe began farming the land to the east of town in 1836 and the land to the west was farmed by Daniel Hahn beginning in 1837. Because no farmers wanted to plant and plow on the large hill and the necessary traffic, this uptown area was not only an economic choice, but also an opportunistic option for merchants.<br>

		</p>
		<p>          The intersection at the top of the hill has, and continues to be, the historic heart of the town. Through the years we have photographic evidence that there was a watering trough right in the middle of this intersection, which again testified to the fact that the horses, wagons, mulls, and oxen would water at the top of the hill before going on.<br>
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>          Another interesting point to note is that the topography of the hill clearly demonstrates the historical development. Mt. Vernon developed primarily along the hill with the south side, and then later began to develop along the north side. The grade of the hill falls more sharply to the north than the south, which may account for the slower development on the north side. Just two blocks east of this corner is a deep streambed that must be crossed to reach the cemetery, which acted as a barrier to Mt. Vernon's development to the east.<br>

		<p>          The downtown area was built generally between 1888 and 1904. The economy was rather good and the disastrous fires of 1893-94 created the opportunity for new brick (fireproof) buildings. <br>
