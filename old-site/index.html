			<h4><font size="3" color="white">The MVHPC Web Site is an educational tool for the purpose of introducing people to the art of preservation. The site includes information on individual structures as well as some history of Mount Vernon. The <a href="Design%20Review.html">design review</a> section is there as a resource for residents who choose to participate in our exiting preservation efforts, as well as a explanation of expectations of historic property owners. There is information available for projects as big as an addition or a new paint job to projects as small as a new window sign or door.</font></h4>
